Now you can put a cage around the blades. It turns out that hasn't helped at all, for an interesting reason statistically. Rotors mainly don't kill manatees -- the keel does. You see manatees with rotor scars is because it doesn't kill them. Then you don't show up in the sample."}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="On the left is a hypothetical and completely ridiculous example. Like what we've looked at so far, where there are independent additive terms.

## Building an interaction

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Economics of Africa. Africa is really really big. A lot of diversity - economies, language, environment - makes it interesting because it creates a lot of natural experiments."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '15.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="There's a feature of the terrain which is ruggedness, which is bad becasuse it makes it hard to move things. On the right is normalised. 0 is perfectly flat, 1 is Lesotho, the world's most rugged place. Kind of like Switzerland. Really strong negative relationship with GDP. But in Africa, the relationship goes in the other direction. Removing outliers doesn't remove the difference between the continents. So what's going on?"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '16.png'))
```

```{r 8.1}
library(rethinking)
data(rugged)
d <- rugged

# make log version of outcome
d$log_gdp <- log( d$rgdppc_2000 )

# extract countries with GDP data
dd <- d[ complete.cases(d$rgdppc_2000) , ]

# rescale variables
dd$log_gdp_std <- dd$log_gdp / mean(dd$log_gdp)
dd$rugged_std <- dd$rugged / max(dd$rugged)
```

Remember that using $\bar{r}$ just makes it easier to assign a prior to the intercept $\alpha$.

Consider first the intercept, $\alpha$, defined as the log GDP when ruggedness is at the sample mean. So it must be close to 1, because we scaled the outcome so that the mean is 1. 

Now for $\beta$, the slope. If we center it on zero, that indicates no bias for positive or negative, which makes sense. But what about the standard deviation? Let’s start with a guess at 1.

And finally, let’s assign $\sigma$ something very broad, $\sigma \sim Exponential(1)$.

```{r 8.2}
m8.1 <- quap(
  alist(
    log_gdp_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a + b*( rugged_std - 0.215 ) ,
    a ~ dnorm( 1 , 1 ) ,
    b ~ dnorm( 0 , 1 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=dd )
```


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="We want to develop priors that constrain pre-data the outcomes to the possible outcome space. We've scaled the outcome between 0 and 1. Then I've taken log GDP, and scaled it in proportion to the average. 1.5 is 50% more. Think about doubling the economy - that would be a huge effect. The dashed lines are the world's GDPs. We've centered at 1 for the average GDP. We simulate priors and we get chaos. At least on the right you can stay within the world's possible economies."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '17.png'))
```

Let's look at the prior predictions:

```{r 8.3}
set.seed(7)
prior <- extract.prior( m8.1 )

# set up the plot dimensions
plot( NULL , xlim=c(0,1) , ylim=c(0.5,1.5) ,
  xlab="ruggedness" , ylab="log GDP" )
abline( h=min(dd$log_gdp_std) , lty=2 )
abline( h=max(dd$log_gdp_std) , lty=2 )

# draw 50 lines from the prior
rugged_seq <- seq( from=-0.1 , to=1.1 , length.out=30 )
mu <- link( m8.1 , post=prior , data=data.frame(rugged_std=rugged_seq) )
for ( i in 1:50 ) lines( rugged_seq , mu[i,] , col=col.alpha("black",0.3) )
```

```{r 8.4}
sum( abs(prior$b) > 0.6 ) / length(prior$b)
```

```{r 8.5}
m8.1 <- quap(
  alist(
    log_gdp_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a + b*( rugged_std - 0.215 ) ,
    a ~ dnorm( 1 , 0.1 ) ,
    b ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.3 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp(1)
  ) , data=dd )
```

```{r 8.6}
precis( m8.1 )
```

Really no overall association between terrain ruggedness and log GDP. Next we’ll see how to split apart the continents.

***8.1.2. Adding an indicator variable isn't enough***

```{r 8.7}
# make variable to index Africa (1) or not (2)
dd$cid <- ifelse( dd$cont_africa==1 , 1 , 2 )
```

```{r 8.8}
m8.2 <- quap(
  alist(
    log_gdp_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a[cid] + b*( rugged_std - 0.215 ) ,
    a[cid] ~ dnorm( 1 , 0.1 ) ,
    b ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.3 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=dd )
```

```{r 8.9}
rethinking::compare( m8.1 , m8.2 )
```

```{r 8.10}
precis( m8.2 , depth=2 )
```

```{r 8.11}
post <- extract.samples(m8.2)
diff_a1_a2 <- post$a[,1] - post$a[,2]
PI( diff_a1_a2 )
```

The difference is reliably below zero.

```{r 8.12}
rugged.seq <- seq( from=-0.1 , to=1.1 , length.out=30 )
# compute mu over samples, fixing cid=2 and then cid=1
mu.NotAfrica <- link( m8.2 ,
  data=data.frame( cid=2 , rugged_std=rugged.seq ) )
mu.Africa <- link( m8.2 ,
  data=data.frame( cid=1 , rugged_std=rugged.seq ) )
# summarize to means and intervals
mu.NotAfrica_mu <- apply( mu.NotAfrica , 2 , mean )
mu.NotAfrica_ci <- apply( mu.NotAfrica , 2 , PI , prob=0.97 )
mu.Africa_mu <- apply( mu.Africa , 2 , mean )
mu.Africa_ci <- apply( mu.Africa , 2 , PI , prob=0.97 )
```


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="These two plots come from splitting the data. This is cheating, because now you have no statistical criterion on which to evaluate the split. Need to estimate both of the lines in the same model. DOn't split it yourself - let the model split it and tell you how compelling it is."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '18.png'))
```



```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Using an index variable that is continent ID. 1 means Africa, 2 means not Africa. Can do it for each continent. Different $\\alpha$ for each continent. Now you can assign the same prior to all of the continents. We run the model and get the graphs on the right. The intercepts now have changed, and African countries are depressed relative to non-African countries."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '19.png'))
```

***8.1.3. Adding an interaction does work***

This just means making the slope conditional on continent.

```{r}

```


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Just add the index variable to the slope. Now we have a separete slope for ecah continent. Centered the GDP so that the intercept makes sense. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '20.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '21.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Here are the marginal posterior distributions. Index of 1 means Africa, 2 means not Africa. Average GDP is lower. At the mean ruggedness, in the world, an African country has 90% of the average GDP in the sample. How does GDP change? It's postivie for AFrican countries `b[1]`, and `b[2]` is negative. Basically the same magnitude."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '22.png'))
```

```{r 8.13}
m8.3 <- quap(
  alist(
    log_gdp_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a[cid] + b[cid]*( rugged_std - 0.215 ) ,
    a[cid] ~ dnorm( 1 , 0.1 ) ,
    b[cid] ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.3 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=dd )
```



```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now they're from the same model. Looks the same. The slope on the left is less certain. Compatibility bowtie is bigger because there are fewer African countries. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '23.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Here we're just looking at two categories, but it can get confusing quickly, especially if you don't center the variables. Need to plot to understand. **Whenever you have an interaction, the impact of a change in one predictor depends on more that one parameter.** So you can't look at a single row and guess what the effect is of changing things. You need them all. This is why plotting is so essential."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '24.png'))
```

```{r 8.14}
precis( m8.3 , depth=2 )
```

```{r 8.15}
rethinking::compare( m8.1 , m8.2 , m8.3 , func=PSIS )
```

Model family m8.3 has more than 95% of the weight. That’s very strong support for including the interaction effect, if prediction is our goal. But the modicum of weight given to `m8.2` suggests that the posterior means for the slopes in `m8.3` are a little overfit.

```{r 8.16}
plot( PSIS( m8.3 , pointwise=TRUE )$k )
```

***8.1.4. Plotting the interaction***

```{r}
# plot Africa - cid=1
d.A1 <- dd[ dd$cid==1 , ]
plot( d.A1$rugged_std , d.A1$log_gdp_std , pch=16 , col=rangi2 ,
  xlab="ruggedness (standardized)" , ylab="log GDP (as proportion of mean)" ,
  xlim=c(0,1) )
mu <- link( m8.3 , data=data.frame( cid=1 , rugged_std=rugged_seq ) )
mu_mean <- apply( mu , 2 , mean )
mu_ci <- apply( mu , 2 , PI , prob=0.97 )
lines( rugged_seq , mu_mean , lwd=2 )
shade( mu_ci , rugged_seq , col=col.alpha(rangi2,0.3) )

mtext("African nations")
# plot non-Africa - cid=2
d.A0 <- dd[ dd$cid==2 , ]
plot( d.A0$rugged_std , d.A0$log_gdp_std , pch=1 , col="black" ,
  xlab="ruggedness (standardized)" , ylab="log GDP (as proportion of mean)" ,
  xlim=c(0,1) )
mu <- link( m8.3 , data=data.frame( cid=2 , rugged_std=rugged_seq ) )
mu_mean <- apply( mu , 2 , mean )
mu_ci <- apply( mu , 2 , PI , prob=0.97 )
lines( rugged_seq , mu_mean , lwd=2 )
shade( mu_ci , rugged_seq )
mtext("Non-African nations")
```

## Symmetry of interactions

A simple interaction model contains two symmetrical interpretations. Absent some other information, outside the model, there’s no logical basis for preferring one over the other.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="There's a causal symmetry to them. You can't tell the difference. Only way is to use your scientific knowledge. You're bringing in your extra knowledge with the first interpretation. In the statstical model, the second is the same, but it doesn't make sense because a country can't switch continents."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '25.png'))
```

```{r 8.18}
rugged_seq <- seq(from=-0.2,to=1.2,length.out=30)
muA <- link( m8.3 , data=data.frame(cid=1,rugged_std=rugged_seq) )
muN <- link( m8.3 , data=data.frame(cid=2,rugged_std=rugged_seq) )
delta <- muA - muN
```


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now this is trying to predict the effect of moving a country to a different continent. y-axis is expected improvement if we move the nation to Africa. At low ruggedness you expect it to hurt the economy, but at high ruggedness you expect it to help it. We can see that this interpretation is causally ridiculous. But the model doesn't see them as different things. The reason this is confusing is because there is causal information in your head. You want to interpret the variables in certain ways."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '26.png'))
```

## Continuous interactions

Interpretation is much harder with continuous variables, even though the mathematics of the model are essentially the same.

***8.3.1. A winter flower***

```{r 8.19}
library(rethinking)
data(tulips)
d <- tulips
str(d)
```

```{r 8.20}
d$blooms_std <- d$blooms / max(d$blooms)
d$water_cent <- d$water - mean(d$water)
d$shade_cent <- d$shade - mean(d$shade)
```


Now `blooms_std` ranges from 0 to 1, and both water_cent and shade_cent range from −1 to 1. I’ve scaled blooms by its maximum observed value, for three reasons. First, the large values on the raw scale will make optimization difficult. Second, it will be easier to assign a reasonable prior this way. Third, we don’t want to standardize blooms, because zero is a meaningful boundary we want to preserve.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now here both predictors are continuous. Basically works the same way, but much harder to think about. Experimental example but works the same in observationals. 3 variables of interest plus the experimental block which you want to control for. We're going to leave out `block` and add that in later. Three levels of water and shade, with the outcome bloom area. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '27.png'))
```
```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="They're categorical, but in principle they're continuous. This is the conventional form of the interaction. When you add an interaction of continous variables, you multiply the predictors and add a third coefficient. First is to understand why this happens. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '28.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Here is the conventional form on top. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '29.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="It means we replace one of these slopes with another linear model. Now $W$ will be the centered version, as with $S$ for shade. We've replaced the $\\beta$ coefficient in front of water level with $\\gamma$, and $\\gamma$ isn't a parameter but a linear model. Another one. We can have as many as we want. And this linear model now tells us the slope. And the slope has two parameters in it. One is the ordinary slope, $\\beta_W$, and the other $\\beta_{WS}$, is the interaction. That parameter measures the marginal effect of changing shade on the impact of water. So we're directly assuming that the effect of water depends on shade. And we make the submodel, which is linear because we're still in geocentric world. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '30.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="It doesnt' matter which one you pick, you get the same equation. Basically, this is where it comes from - assuming I want the association of each with the outcome to be dependent on the other's value, so let's make a linear model of that. Liek a regression within a regression. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '31.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Let's fit this. Contrasting one with and without an interaction. Main effect of water, main effect of shade. With priors. But we've already got the problem of how to visualise this."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '32.png'))
```

```{r 8.21}
a <- rnorm( 1e4 , 0.5 , 1 ); sum( a < 0 | a > 1 ) / length( a )
```

If it’s 0.5 units from the mean to zero, then a standard deviation of 0.25 should put only 5% of the mass outside the valid internal. Let’s see:

```{r 8.22}
a <- rnorm( 1e4 , 0.5 , 0.25 ); sum( a < 0 | a > 1 ) / length( a )
```

Much better.

```{r 8.23}
m8.4 <- quap(
  alist(
    blooms_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a + bw*water_cent + bs*shade_cent ,
    a ~ dnorm( 0.5 , 0.25 ) ,
    bw ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    bs ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=d )
```

Now with the interaction:

```{r 8.24}
m8.5 <- quap(
  alist(
    blooms_std ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu <- a + bw*water_cent + bs*shade_cent + bws*water_cent*shade_cent ,
    a ~ dnorm( 0.5 , 0.25 ) ,
    bw ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    bs ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    bws ~ dnorm( 0 , 0.25 ) ,
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
  ) , data=d )
```

***8.3.3. Plotting posterior predictions***


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Related frames that tell a bigger story. Going to have graphs in triptych form. Nothing binding you to only three, but that's the minimum. You can do 20 if you think that's necessary."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '33.png'))
```

```{r 8.25}

  for ( i in 1:20 ) lines( -1:1 , mu[i,] , col=col.alpha("black",0.3) )
}
```

***8.3.4. Plotting prior predictions***

```{r 8.26}
set.seed(7)

```


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Here's the triptych for the prior predictions Just showing you that the outcomes are staying within the legal range.

The slope is always the same, because there's no interaction."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '34.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="The posterior predictions are plotted as these lines. Same arrangement as the tritpych. Notice that we're missing the data in each case here. Why? Because the slope is the same in each graph. It's doing a pretty bad job a prediction. Water has no effect if you have no light, and vice versa. There's necessarily an interaction."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '35.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now we've added the interaction term. You can't look at just `bws` because it depends on other parameters now, so you have to push things out through the predictions. Need to look at its behaviour."}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="On the left, shade is low, meaning there's a lot of light. Which means a big effect for water, because as you add water, you get a lot of growth. On the right the plant can't do much because it doesn't get much light."}

```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="In this data, we've cut all backdoors between shade and water because it's an experiment. This isn't the real knowledge we want to know how real plants grow. What's the difference? Shade influences water level because it reduces evaporation. So shady flowers can grow better because they retain more moisture. That's the backdoor path. Need to think about this when you're considering intervening. You can't just cut down the trees to give the flowers more light and let them dehydrate. Need to think carefully about these things."}
