Make a mean-centered version of `rugged_std`.
```{r}
dd <-

  mutate(rugged_std_c  = rugged_std - mean(rugged_std))
```


Remember that using $\bar{r}$ just makes it easier to assign a prior to the intercept $\alpha$.

Consider first the intercept, $\alpha$, defined as the log GDP when ruggedness is at the sample mean. So it must be close to 1, because we scaled the outcome so that the mean is 1. 

Now for $\beta$, the slope. If we center it on zero, that indicates no bias for positive or negative, which makes sense. But what about the standard deviation? Let’s start with a guess at 1.

And finally, let’s assign $\sigma$ something very broad, $\sigma \sim Exponential(1)$.

```{r 8.2, results = "hide"}
b8.1 <-
  brm(data = dd, 
      family = gaussian,
      log_gdp_std ~ 1 + rugged_std_c,
      prior = c(prior(normal(1, 1), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 8,
      sample_prior = T, # allows us to use `prior_samples()`
      file = "fits/b08.01")
```




```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="We want to develop priors that constrain pre-data the outcomes to the possible outcome space. We've scaled the outcome between 0 and 1.

We've centered at 1 for the average GDP. We simulate priors and we get chaos. At least on the right you can stay within the world's possible economies."}

Really no overall association between terrain ruggedness and log GDP. Next we’ll see how to split apart the continents.

***8.1.2. Adding an indicator variable isn't enough***

```{r 8.7}
# make variable to index Africa (1) or not (2)
dd <- 
  dd %>%

Note we're suppressing the default intercept via the `0 + ...` syntax.
```{r 8.8}

      log_gdp_std ~ 0 + cid + rugged_std_c,
      prior = c(prior(normal(1, 0.1), class = b, coef = cid1),
                prior(normal(1, 0.1), class = b, coef = cid2),
                prior(normal(0, 0.3), class = b, coef = rugged_std_c),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 8,
      file = "fits/b08.02")
```

```{r 8.9}

The difference is reliably below zero.

Model family b8.3 has more than 95% of the weight. That’s very strong support for including the interaction effect, if prediction is our goal. But the modicum of weight given to `m8.2` suggests that the posterior means for the slopes in `m8.3` are a little overfit.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now this is trying to predict the effect of moving a country to a different continent. y-axis is expected improvement if we move the nation to Africa. At low ruggedness you expect it to hurt the economy, but at high ruggedness you expect it to help it. We can see that this interpretation is causally ridiculous. But the model doesn't see them as different things. The reason this is confusing is because there is causal information in your head. You want to interpret the variables in certain ways."}

## Continuous interactions

Interpretation is much harder with continuous variables, even though the mathematics of the model are essentially the same.

***8.3.1. A winter flower***

```{r 8.19}
data(tulips, package = "rethinking")
d <- tulips
rm(tulips)

glimpse(d)
```

***8.3.2. The models***

```{r 8.20}
d <-
  d %>% 
  mutate(blooms_std = blooms / max(blooms),
         water_cent = water - mean(water),
         shade_cent = shade - mean(shade))
```


Now `blooms_std` ranges from 0 to 1, and both water_cent and shade_cent range from −1 to 1. I’ve scaled blooms by its maximum observed value, for three reasons. First, the large values on the raw scale will make optimization difficult. Second, it will be easier to assign a reasonable prior this way. Third, we don’t want to standardize blooms, because zero is a meaningful boundary we want to preserve.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now here both predictors are continuous. Basically works the same way, but much harder to think about. Experimental example but works the same in observationals. 3 variables of interest plus the experimental block which you want to control for. We're going to leave out `block` and add that in later. Three levels of water and shade, with the outcome bloom area. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '27.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="They're categorical, but in principle they're continuous. This is the conventional form of the interaction. When you add an interaction of continous variables, you multiply the predictors and add a third coefficient. First is to understand why this happens. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '28.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Here is the conventional form on top. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '29.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="It means we replace one of these slopes with another linear model. Now $W$ will be the centered version, as with $S$ for shade. We've replaced the $\\beta$ coefficient in front of water level with $\\gamma$, and $\\gamma$ isn't a parameter but a linear model. Another one. We can have as many as we want. And this linear model now tells us the slope. And the slope has two parameters in it. One is the ordinary slope, $\\beta_W$, and the other $\\beta_{WS}$, is the interaction. That parameter measures the marginal effect of changing shade on the impact of water. So we're directly assuming that the effect of water depends on shade. And we make the submodel, which is linear because we're still in geocentric world. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '30.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="It doesnt' matter which one you pick, you get the same equation. Basically, this is where it comes from - assuming I want the association of each with the outcome to be dependent on the other's value, so let's make a linear model of that. Liek a regression within a regression. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '31.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Let's fit this. Contrasting one with and without an interaction. Main effect of water, main effect of shade. With priors. But we've already got the problem of how to visualise this."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '32.png'))
```

```{r 8.21}
set.seed(8)

tibble(a = rnorm(1e4, mean = 0.5, sd = 1)) %>% 
  summarise(proportion_outside_of_the_range = sum(a < 0 | a > 1) / n())
```

If it’s 0.5 units from the mean to zero, then a standard deviation of 0.25 should put only 5% of the mass outside the valid internal. Let’s see:

```{r 8.22}
set.seed(8)

tibble(a = rnorm(1e4, mean = 0.5, sd = 0.25)) %>% 
  summarise(proportion_outside_of_the_range = sum(a < 0 | a > 1) / n())
```

Much better.

Ranges for the two predictors:
```{r}
range(d$water_cent)
range(d$shade_cent)
```


```{r 8.23}
b8.4 <-
  brm(data = d, 
      family = gaussian,
      blooms_std ~ 1 + water_cent + shade_cent,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0.5, 0.25), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 0.25), class = b, coef = water_cent),
                prior(normal(0, 0.25), class = b, coef = shade_cent),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 8,
      file = "fits/b08.04")
```

```{r}
print(b8.4)
```


Now with the interaction:

```{r 8.24}
b8.5 <-
  brm(data = d, 
      family = gaussian,
      blooms_std ~ 1 + water_cent + shade_cent + water_cent:shade_cent,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0.5, 0.25), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 0.25), class = b, coef = water_cent),
                prior(normal(0, 0.25), class = b, coef = shade_cent),
                prior(normal(0, 0.25), class = b, coef = "water_cent:shade_cent"),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 8,
      file = "fits/b08.05")
```

```{r}
print(b8.5)
```
