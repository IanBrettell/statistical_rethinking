There are a bunch of off-the-shelf tools that have value. But eventually in your research you have to do better than off-the-shelf. You need to make it bespoke. We want besoke models and risk analyses. Your analysis needs to be bespoke to the problem at hand. It's ethically irresponsible to do anything else."}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Accuracy always matters, but it's not the only thing that matters. When you make a decision, you have to take into account the costs and benefits of each course of action. Even though it was a tail probability that it could have been that bad, if it was, it would have been catastrophic. You may need to plan for the extreme events in case many people die."}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="This is a manatee. Related to an elephant. Gentle vegetarian mermaid. The only natural predator it has is the speedboat. This is quite common to manatees in Florida, where a lot of people own speedboats. Probably more manatees than not have these sorts of scars. Florida has gone to a lot of effort to avoid this. Now you can put a cage around the blades. It turns out that hasn't helped at all, for an interesting reason statistically. Rotors mainly don't kill manatees -- the keel does. You see manatees with rotor scars is because it doesn't kill them. Then you don't show up in the sample."}

The RAF asked the statistician to look at the damage pattern and figure out where to put the armour. You need to armour selectively to avoid weighing the whole thing down. So what's the most crucial place? The intuition was to put the armour where the damage was. Wald went for the opposite, because he didn't condition on this collider. None of the planes that made it back had holes in the cockpit or engine. So he recommended up-armouring the parts with the least damage."}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="The variable we've conditioned on is survival. Selection bias. It opens the path... the rotor damage confounds survival. This is very common when there are multiple things that can affect these outcomes."}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="We need to grow up our models. Everything we do is about conditioning. Everything is conditional. Today we'll work on how the influence of some variable is conditional on other variables. We'll build it in because nature is additive."}

On the right is normalised. 0 is perfectly flat, 1 is Lesotho, the world's most rugged place. Kind of like Switzerland. Really strong negative relationship with GDP. But in Africa, the relationship goes in the other direction. Removing outliers doesn't remove the difference between the continents. So what's going on?"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '16.png'))

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="We want to develop priors that constrain pre-data the outcomes to the possible outcome space. We've scaled the outcome between 0 and 1. Then I've taken log GDP, and scaled it in proportion to the average. 1.5 is 50% more. Think about doubling the economy - that would be a huge effect. The dashed lines are the world's GDPs. We've centered at 1 for the average GDP. We simulate priors and we get chaos. At least on the right you can stay within the world's possible economies."}

At the mean ruggedness, in the world, an African country has 90% of the average GDP in the sample. How does GDP change? It's postivie for AFrican countries `b[1]`, and `b[2]` is negative. Basically the same magnitude."}

```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Here we're just looking at two categories, but it can get confusing quickly, especially if you don't center the variables. Need to plot to understand. **Whenever you have an interaction, the impact of a change in one predictor depends on more that one parameter.** So you can't look at a single row and guess what the effect is of changing things. You need them all. This is why plotting is so essential."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '24.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="There's a causal symmetry to them. You can't tell the difference. Only way is to use your scientific knowledge. You're bringing in your extra knowledge with the first interpretation. In the statstical model, the second is the same, but it doesn't make sense because a country can't switch continents."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '25.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now this is trying to predict the effect of moving a country to a different continent. y-axis is expected improvement if we move the nation to Africa. At low ruggedness you expect it to hurt the economy, but at high ruggedness you expect it to help it. We can see that this interpretation is causally ridiculous. But the model doesn't see them as different things. The reason this is confusing is because there is causal information in your head. You want to interpret the variables in certain ways."}

```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now here both predictors are continuous. Basically works the same way, but much harder to think about. Experimental example but works the same in observationals. 3 variables of interest plus the experimental block which you want to control for. We're going to leave out `block` and add that in later. Three levels of water and shade, with the outcome bloom area. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '27.png'))
```
```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="They're categorical, but in principle they're continuous. This is the conventional form of the interaction. When you add an interaction of continous variables, you multiply the predictors and add a third coefficient. First is to understand why this happens. "}

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '29.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="It means we replace one of these slopes with another linear model. Now $W$ will be the centered version, as with $S$ for shade. We've replaced the $\\beta$ coefficient in front of water level with $\\gamma$, and $\\gamma$ isn't a parameter but a linear model. Another one. We can have as many as we want. And this linear model now tells us the slope. And the slope has two parameters in it. One is the ordinary slope, $\\beta_W$, and the other $\\beta_{WS}$, is the interaction. That parameter measures the marginal effect of changing shade on the impact of water. So we're directly assuming that the effect of water depends on shade. And we make the submodel, which is linear because we're still in geocentric world. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '30.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="It doesnt' matter which one you pick, you get the same equation. Basically, this is where it comes from - assuming I want the association of each with the outcome to be dependent on the other's value, so let's make a linear model of that. Liek a regression within a regression. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '31.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Let's fit this. Contrasting one with and without an interaction. Main effect of water, main effect of shade. With priors. But we've already got the problem of how to visualise this."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '32.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Related frames that tell a bigger story. Going to have graphs in triptych form. Nothing binding you to only three, but that's the minimum. You can do 20 if you think that's necessary."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '33.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Here's the triptych for the prior predictions Just showing you that the outcomes are staying within the legal range. Don't want to predict negative outcomes. I'd make them even tighter. The black lines come from the same sample from the prior distribution. The slope is always the same, because there's no interaction."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '34.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="The posterior predictions are plotted as these lines. Same arrangement as the tritpych. Notice that we're missing the data in each case here. Why? Because the slope is the same in each graph. It's doing a pretty bad job a prediction. Water has no effect if you have no light, and vice versa. There's necessarily an interaction."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '35.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now we've added the interaction term. You can't look at just `bws` because it depends on other parameters now, so you have to push things out through the predictions. Need to look at its behaviour."}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="On the left, shade is low, meaning there's a lot of light. Which means a big effect for water, because as you add water, you get a lot of growth. On the right the plant can't do much because it doesn't get much light."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '38.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="In this data, we've cut all backdoors between shade and water because it's an experiment. This isn't the real knowledge we want to know how real plants grow. What's the difference? Shade influences water level because it reduces evaporation. So shady flowers can grow better because they retain more moisture. That's the backdoor path. Need to think about this when you're considering intervening. You can't just cut down the trees to give the flowers more light and let them dehydrate. Need to think carefully about these things."}

```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="There may be good scientific reasons to go beyond to further interactions. Slope times each predictor, then three two-way interactions, because they're all possible. Then there's a 3-way where the extent to which the first depends on the second depends on the third."}
