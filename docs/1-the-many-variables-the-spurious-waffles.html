<p>Goals:
1. Figure out whether the approximation of the posterior works. Compare the predictions with the raw data. If they’re different, they fail.
2. It can inspire you to look at the cases that don’t fit well, and figure out what you need to make better causal inferences.</p>

Figure 1.29: Another good thing regression can do is reveal spurious correlations. When there are two predictors that both influence the outcome in different directions, you can get the total causal effect between the two. This tends to arise where you have two predictors, and they act in different directions, and cancel each other out, so if you don’t model both of them individually, it looks like they have no effect.

Figure 1.30: Relationship between milk energy and how brainy they are? Intersted in things that are interested in what makes us unique. Primates are mammals, and some mammals have very highly energetic milk, like seals basically ooze butter. Primates in contrast carry their offspring on them. As a consequence, the energy density is lower. Human milk is not energetically rich. 75% of our brain mass is neocortex. Then the brainiest primate is <em>Cebus</em>. Can we see a signal of selection on milk energy from braininess?
