<p>Any of the models from previous chapters that used dummy variables to handle categories are programmed for amnesia. These models implicitly assume that nothing learned about any one category informs estimates for the other categories — the parameters are independent of one another and learn from completely separate portions of the data.</p>
<p>Anterograde amnesia is bad for learning about the world.</p>

<p>As the robot observes waiting times, it updates everything: the estimates for each café as well as the estimates for the population. If the population seems highly variable, then the prior is flat and uninformative and, as a consequence, the observations at any one café do very little to the estimate at another. If instead the population seems to contain little variation, then the prior is narrow and highly informative. An observation at any one café will have a big impact on estimates at any other café.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="slides/L15/04.png" alt="Imagine you're visiting some cafes. The experience is largely the same. Here we're contrasting Paris and Berlin. Let's focus on one aspect of ordering - how long you wait for your cofffee. If you've never been to a cafe, you have no expectation of how long it takes. Then you go to Paris, and it takes 5 minutes. Then when you go to Berlin, you don't forget that experience, but you also don't think it's going to be exactly the same. A remmbering model treats a cafe as a population. And you can transfer infomration among units in that population. And that allows for better estaimtes for every cafe. Other thing to think is if it takes 10 minutes in Berlin, you had your 5 mintue prior, you update that with Bayesian updating, but the time order should be irrelevant to your learning. Now you need to update Paris too, because you have a limited sample in Paris, and you've got data from Berlin. So data from both are relevant to updating both of them. " width="80%" />

<p>In this chapter, you’ll see the formal version of this argument and how it leads us to MULTILEVEL MODELS. These models remember features of each cluster in the data as they learn about all of the clusters. Depending upon the variation among clusters, which is learned from the data as well, the model pools information across clusters. This pooling tends to improve estimates about each cluster. This improved estimation leads to several, more pragmatic sounding, benefits of the multilevel approach. I mentioned them in Chapter 1. They are worth repeating.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Improved estimates for repeat sampling</em>. When more than one observation arises from the same individual, location, or time, then traditional, single-level models either maximally underfit or overfit the data.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Improved estimates for imbalance in sampling</em>. When some individuals, locations, or times are sampled more than others, multilevel models automatically cope with differing uncertainty across these clusters. This prevents over-sampled clusters from unfairly dominating inference.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Estimates of variation</em>. If our research questions include variation among individuals or other groups within the data, then multilevel models are a big help, because they model variation explicitly.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Avoid averaging, retain variation</em>. Frequently, scholars pre-average some data to construct variables. This can be dangerous, because averaging removes variation, and there are also typically several different ways to perform the averaging. Averaging therefore both manufactures false confidence and introduces arbitrary data transformations. Multilevel models allow us to preserve the uncertainty and avoid data transformations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is better to begin to build a multilevel analysis, and then realize it’s unnecessary, than to overlook it.</p>
