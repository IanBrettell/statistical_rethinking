## Multicollinearity

Means a very strong association between two or more predictors. 

Consequence: the posterior distribution will seem to suggest that none of the variables is reliably associated with the outcome, even if all of the variables are in reality strongly associated with the outcome.

That said, the model will work fine for prediction; you will just be frustrated trying to understand it.

***6.1.1 Multicollinear legs***

Imagine trying to predict an individual's height using the length of their legs as a predictor. But once you put both legs (right and left) into the model, something vexing will happen. 


```r
n <- 100
set.seed(909)

d <- 
  tibble(height   = rnorm(n, mean = 10, sd = 2),
         leg_prop = runif(n, min = 0.4, max = 0.5)) %>% 
  mutate(leg_left  = leg_prop * height + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.02),
         leg_right = leg_prop * height + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.02))
```

We expect the beta coefficient that measures the association of a leg with height to end up around the average height (10) divided by 45% of the average height (4.5). 


```r
d %>%
  dplyr::select(leg_left:leg_right) %>%
  cor() %>%
  round(digits = 4)
```

```
##           leg_left leg_right
## leg_left    1.0000    0.9997
## leg_right   0.9997    1.0000
```


```r
d %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = leg_left, y = leg_right)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/2, color = "forestgreen")
```

The posterior distribution for these two parameters is very hgihly correlated, with all of the plausible values of `bl` and `br` lying around a narrow ridge. When `bl` is large, then `br` must be small. Since both leg variables contain almost exactly the same information, if you insist on including both in a model, then there will be a practically infinite number of combinations of `bl` and `br` that produce the same predictions.

Compute the posterior distribution and plot it.

The basic lesson is this:
>When two predictor varilables are very strongly correlated (conditional on other variables in the model), including both in a model may lead to confusion.

Given the strong association of each predictor with the outcome, we might conclude that both variables are reliable predictors of total energy in milk, across species. But watch what happens when we place both predictor variables in the same regression model:


```r
b6.5 <- 
  brm(data = d, 
      family = gaussian,
      k ~ 1 + f+ l,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 6,
      file = "fits/b06.05")
```


```r
brms::posterior_samples(b6.5) %>% round(digits = 2)
```

Either helps in predicting `kcal.per.g`, but neither helps as much *once you already know the other*.

DAG the sense out of it:


```r
dag_coords <-
  tibble(name = c("L", "D", "F", "K"),
         x    = c(1, 2, 3, 2),
         y    = c(2, 2, 2, 1))

ggdag::dagify(L ~ D,
       F ~ D,
       K ~ L + F,
       coords = dag_coords) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  ggdag::geom_dag_point(aes(color = name == "D"),
                        alpha = 1/2, size = 6.5, show.legend = F) +

Some fields actually teach students to inspect pairwise correlations before fitting a model, to identify and drop highly correlated predictors. This is a mistake. Pairwise correlations are not the problem. It is the conditional associations—not correlations—that matter. 

Now let's see how the imprecision of the posterior increases with association between two predictors.


```r
# define a custom function
sim_coll <- function(seed, rho) {
  
  # simulate the data
  set.seed(seed)
  
  d <-
    d %>% 
    mutate(x = rnorm(n(), 
                     mean = perc.fat * rho,
                     sd = sqrt((1 - rho^2) * var(perc.fat))))
    
  # fit an OLS model
  m <- lm(kcal.per.g ~ perc.fat + x, data = d)
  
  # extract the parameter SD
  sqrt(diag(vcov(m)))[2]
  
}

# how many simulations per `rho`-value would you like?
n_seed <- 100
# how many `rho`-values from 0 to .99 would you like to evaluate the process over?
n_rho  <- 30

d <-
  crossing(seed = 1:n_seed,
           rho  = seq(from = 0, to = .99, length.out = n_rho))  %>% 
  mutate(parameter_sd = purrr::map2_dbl(seed, rho, sim_coll)) %>% 
  group_by(rho) %>% 
  # we'll `summarise()` our output by the mean and 95% intervals
  summarise(mean = mean(parameter_sd),
            ll   = quantile(parameter_sd, prob = .025),
            ul   = quantile(parameter_sd, prob = .975))

# Add 95% interval bands
d %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = rho, y = mean)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(ymin = ll, ymax = ul),
              stat = "identity",
              fill = "orange", color = "orange", alpha = 1/3, size = 2/3) +
  labs(x = expression(rho),
       y = "parameter SD") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, .0072))

***6.2.1. A prior is born***

We should allow $p$ to be less than 1, in case the experiment goes horribly wrong and we kill all the plants. We also have to ensure that $p > 0$, because it is a proportion. 

$$
h_{1,i}\sim Normal(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i = h_{0,i} \times p
$$

Take a look as the $p \sim LogNormal(0, 0.25)$

```r
set.seed(6)

# simulate
sim_p <-
  tibble(sim_p = rlnorm(1e4, meanlog = 0, sdlog = 0.25)) 

# wrangle
sim_p %>% 
  mutate(`exp(sim_p)` = exp(sim_p)) %>%
  gather() %>% 
  
  # plot
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_density(fill = "steelblue") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, .5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 6)) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~ key, scale = "free_y", ncol = 1)
```

<img src="06_the_haunted_dag_and_the_causal_terror_files/figure-html/6.14-1.png" width="672" />


```r
sim_p %>% 
  mutate(`exp(sim_p)` = exp(sim_p)) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>%
  group_by(name) %>% 
  tidybayes::mean_qi(.width = .89) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.double, round, digits = 2)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 7
##   name       value .lower .upper .width .point .interval
##   <chr>      <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>

***6.2.2. Blocked by consequence***

>So when we control for fungus, the model is implicitly answering the question: Once we already know whether or not a plant developed fungus, does soil treatment matter? The answer is “no,” because soil treatment has its effects on growth through reducing fungus.

To measure treatment properly, we should omit the post-treatment variable `fungus`.



```r
b6.8 <- 
  brm(data = d, 
      family = gaussian,
      bf(h1 ~ h0 * (a + t * treatment),
         a + t ~ 1,
         nl = TRUE),
      prior = c(prior(lognormal(0, 0.2), nlpar = a, lb = 0),
                prior(normal(0, 0.5), nlpar = t),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 6,
      file = "fits/b06.08")
```


```r
print(b6.8)
```

```

Now the impact of treatment is clearly positive, as it should be.

***6.2.3. Fungus and d-separation***


```r
# define our coordinates
dag_coords <-
  tibble(name = c("H0", "T", "F", "H1"),
         x    = c(1, 5, 4, 3),
         y    = c(2, 2, 1.5, 1))

# save our DAG
dag <-
  ggdag::dagify(F ~ T,
                H1 ~ H0 + F,
                coords = dag_coords)

# make function
gg_simple_dag <- function(d) {
  
  d %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
    ggdag::geom_dag_point(color = "steelblue", alpha = 1/2, size = 6.5) +
    ggdag::geom_dag_text(color = "black") +
    ggdag::geom_dag_edges() + 
    ggdag::theme_dag()

```

<img src="06_the_haunted_dag_and_the_causal_terror_files/figure-html/6.18-1.png" width="672" />

Conditioning on $F$ induces **d-separation**. The "d" stands for *directional*. D-separation means that some variables on a directed graph are independent of others. In this case, $H_1$ is d-separated from $T$, but only when we condition on $F$, because it blocks the path between $T$ and $H_1$. 


```r
dag %>% 
  dagitty::dseparated("T", "H1")
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

```r
dag %>% 
  dagitty::dseparated("T", "H1", "F")
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
dagitty::impliedConditionalIndependencies(dag)
```

```
## F _||_ H0
## H0 _||_ T
## H1 _||_ T | F
```

The first two say that original plant height should not be associated with the treatment of fungus, provided we do not condition on anything.

But consider this DAG:


```r
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("docs/misc_figs/06/fungus_dag.png"))

A regression of $H_1$ on $T$ will show no association between the treatment and plant growth. But if we include $F$ in the model, suddenly there will be an association. Let’s try it.

Rescale age so that the range from 18 to 65 is one unit, i.e. `A` ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 is age 18 and 1 is age 65:


```r
d2 <-
  d %>% 
  filter(age > 17) %>% 
  mutate(a = (age - 18) / (65 - 18))

## 6  65       0 -0.9473684 1

Save `mid` as a factor to make the results easier to interpret:


```r
d2 <-
  d2 %>% 
  mutate(mid = factor(married + 1, labels = c("single", "married")))

head(d2)
```

```

The model is quite sure that age is negatively associated with happiness. We’d like to compare the inferences from this model to a model that omits marriage status:


```r

Can get `dagitty` to do it for us:


```r
dag_6.1 <- 
  dagitty::dagitty(
    "dag {
    U [unobserved]
    X -> Y
    X <- U <- A -> C -> Y 
    U -> B <- C
    }"
  )

dagitty::adjustmentSets(dag_6.1, exposure = "X", outcome = "Y")
```

```
## { C }
## { A }
```

Conditioning on either $C$ or $A$ would suffice. Conditioning on $C$ is the better idea, from the perspective of efficiency, since it could also help with the precision of the estimate of $X \rightarrow Y$. 

Now consider the second path, passing through $B$. This path does contain a collider, $U → B ← C$ It is therefore already closed, which is why `adjustmentSets` did not mention $B$.

## Summary

>Multiple regression is no oracle, but only a golem. It is logical, but the relationships it describes are conditional associations, not causal influences. Therefore additional information, from outside the model, is needed to make sense of it. This chapter presented introductory examples of some common frustrations: multicollinearity, post-treatment bias, and collider bias. Solutions to these frustrations can be organized under a coherent framework in which hypothetical causal relations among variables are analyzed to cope with confounding. In all cases, causal models exist outside the statistical model and can be difficult to test. However, it is possible to reach valid causal inferences in the absence of experiments. This is good news, because we often cannot perform experiments, both for practical and ethical reasons.

## Practice

6E1.  List three mechanisms by which multiple regression can produce false inferences about causal effects.

* Multicollinearity
* Post-treatment bias
* Collider bias
