Last century, there was a big fight about whether evolution is neutral - most molecular variation had nothing to do with selection. This leads to a mathematical model - neutral equilibrium. To test this, you need another model, a statistical version. You can think about different time scales and frequency histograms. This would be the model on the far right. People did early tests, and it was very hard to reject the hypothesis that evolution is neutral. There's another class of hypotheses called 'selection matters'. But there are different ways that it matters, so you have to make multiple process models. The fluctuating selection model creates the exact same predictions as the neutral model.
