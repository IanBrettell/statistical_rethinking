This chapter introduces one commonplace example of Fortuna and Minerva’s cooperation: the estimation of posterior probability distributions using a stochastic process known as MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO (MCMC). Unlike earlier chapters in this book, here we’ll produce samples from the joint posterior without maximizing anything. Instead of having to lean on quadratic and other approximations of the shape of the posterior, now we’ll be able to sample directly from the posterior without assuming a Gaussian, or any other, shape.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="As a reminder, Bayesian inference is not about how to get the posterior, it's just about the posterior distribution. There are a lot of ways to get it. In this case, you can calculate it a huge number of ways and they're all valid. In biology, Bayesian is thought of as synonymous with Markov Chains. But you can use Markov chains for lots of things. There's a bunch of additional machinery you need to fool around with when you play with Markov chains."}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="We'll discuss for ways to compute the posterior. The analytical approach was used to create the previous slide. Interesting models, but almost always impossible. So you need another way to do the numerical differentiation. Grid I showed you earlier. You've been using `quap` for months now. Unreasonably effective for lots of models. If you're doing maximum likelihood estimation, you're doing the same steps. There's a connection there between lots of standard tools. But now we're going to get into things that make the connection a lot blurrier."}

***9.2.1. Gibbs sampling***

Why would we want an algorithm that allows asymmetric proposals? One reason is that it makes it easier to handle parameters, like standard deviations, that have boundaries at zero. A better reason, however, is that it allows us to generate savvy proposals that explore the posterior distribution more efficiently. By “more efficiently,” I mean that we can acquire an equally good image of the posterior distribution in fewer steps.
The most common way to generate savvy proposals is a technique known as GIBBS SAMPLING.

***9.2.2. High-dimensional problems***


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Here's the famous paper where they first implemented it. Some famous people here. Rosenbluth did most of the programming, and Teller figured out the memory.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="What are Markov Chains? The Metropolis is the simplest verison. Named after Markov.

```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Sometimes you get a model that is to hard to integrate. Often with integrals you're guessing. Not like derivatives. Going in the other direction is much harder. Integrating is sometimes not practical. MCMC is just one of the methods of estimating it. Optimisation (like quap) often targets the wrong area of the distribution ('concentration of measure'). This is why everyone gives up on optimisation once you have more than 100 parameters. This is bread and butter sort of stuff in applied statistics. "}

```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="There are a bunch of different MCMC strategies. Hastings showed that you don't need symmetric proposals, which made them more efficient. Gibbs sampling is extremely efficient, but basically Metropolis. What they have in common is they guess and check. They make a proposal to move somewhere, check the posterior probability at that location, then decide to move. If you make dumb proposals, you won't move. The goal is to constantly move by making really smart proposals. Guess and checking gives you dumb proposals, so you need a completely different strategy: Hamiltonian. Really efficient and can make models with tens of thousands of parameters. Hamiltonians use a gradient. "}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="... like a donut. In high-dimensional spaces, it gets concentrated into thin shells. Picture a hyper-donut. We must sample from it. And the Metropolialogrithm is really bad like that, because it makes a lot of proposals into dead space. You can see it's a donut, but it doesn't. Now the long run is very long indeed. It gets stuck in narrow regions. The basic problem is that the proposals don't know the shape of the distribution."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '30.png'))
```

As models become more complex and contain hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of parameters, both Metropolis and Gibbs sampling become shockingly inefficient. The reason is that they tend to get stuck in small regions of the posterior for potentially a long time. The high number of parameters isn’t the problem so much as the fact that models with many parameters nearly always have regions of high correlation in the posterior. This means that two or more parameters are highly correlated with one another in the posterior samples. You’ve seen this before with, for example, the two legs example in Chapter 6. Why is this a problem? Because high correlation means a narrow ridge of high probability combinations, and both Metropolis and Gibbs make too many dumb proposals of where to go next. So they get stuck.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="You can tune it, but there's a really tight trade-off. On the left we start with the Markov chain. Filled circles are accepted. If you only consider points near you, you'll get more valid proposals, but you'll move really slow. If we lengthen, then we reject more. This is the fundamental trade-off. Really you can't win. Gibbs can do a little better. Butas soon as the dimensions increase, the problem eventually appears. The issue is guess and check."}

## Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

>It appears to be a quite general principle that, whenever there is a randomized way of doing something, then there is a nonrandomized way that delivers better performance but requires more thought. —E. T. Jaynes

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="So what do we do instead? This is a different process entirely. No guess and check. Instead, it runs a physics simulation. We'll represent our parameter state as a coordinate in some high-dimensional space. In more dimensions, you have some hyperspace. You're a particle in this space in some position. Then we'll flick you, and it'll cruise on some surface - the posterior distribution - and record where you stop, then do it again. Because it follows the curvature, it always makes good proposals because it doesn't go into bad areas. So there's no more guessing and checking, all proposals are good proposals."}

If you choose bad values for those, you'll have a bad time. In general it's not as bad as it gets in a 2D Gaussian. Since it's a parabolic bowl, you can get these parabolic loops.

If there were only 2000 samples in total, how can we have more than 2000 effective samples for each parameter? It’s no mistake. The adaptive sampler that Stan uses is so good, it can actually produce sequential samples that are better than uncorrelated. They are anti-correlated. This means it can explore the posterior distribution so efficiently that it can beat random.

Now, how is this chain a healthy one? Typically we look for three things in these trace plots: (1) stationarity, (2) good mixing, and (3) convergence.

## Care and feeding of your Markov chain

***9.5.1. How many samples do you need?***

First, what really matters is the effective number of samples, not the raw number. You can think of `n_eff` as the length of a Markov chain with no autocorrelation that would provide the same quality of estimate as your chain. One consequence of this definition, as you saw earlier in the chapter, is that `n_eff` can be larger than the length of your chain, provided sequential samples are anti-correlated in the right way. While n_eff is only an estimate, it is usually better than the raw number of samples, which can be very misleading.

Second, what do you want to know? If all you want are posterior means, it doesn’t take many samples at all to get very good estimates. Even a couple hundred samples will do. But if you care about the exact shape in the extreme tails of the posterior, the 99th percentile or so, then you’ll need many more.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '64.png'))
```

The warmup setting is more subtle. On the one hand, you want to have the shortest warmup period necessary, so you can get on with real sampling. But on the other hand, more warmup can mean more efficient sampling. With Stan models, typically you can devote as much as half of your total samples, the iter value, to warmup and come out very well. But for simple models like those you’ve fit so far, much less warmup is really needed. Models can vary a lot in the shape of their posterior distributions, so again there is no universally best answer. But if you are having trouble, you might try increasing the warmup. If not, you might try reducing it. 

***9.5.2. How many chains do you need?***

So the question naturally arises: How many chains do we need? There are three answers to this question. First, when initially debugging a model, use a single chain. There are some error messages that don’t display unless you use only one chain. The chain will fail with more than one chain, but the reason may not be displayed. This is why the `ulam` default is `chains=1`. Second, when deciding whether the chains are valid, you need more than one chain. Third, when you begin the final run that you’ll make inferences from, you only really need one chain.

There are exotic situations in which all of the advice above must be modified. But for typical regression models, you can live by the motto:
>One short chain to debug, four chains for verification and inference.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '65.png'))
```

***9.5.3. Taming a wild chain***

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '66.png'))
```

```{r 9.22}
b9.2 <-
  brm(data = list(y = c(-1, 1)), 
      family = gaussian,
      y ~ 1,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 1000), class = Intercept),
                prior(exponential(0.0001), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 3,
      seed = 9,
      file = "fits/b09.02")
```

```{r 9.23}
print(b9.2)
```

Whoa! This posterior can’t be right. The mean of −1 and 1 is zero, so we’re hoping to get a mean value for alpha around zero. Instead we get crazy values and implausibly wide intervals. Inference for sigma is no better. The n_eff and Rhat diagnostics don’t look good either.

You should see something like:

```
Warning messages:
1: There were 67 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta
above 0.95 may help. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup
```

The warnings say that Stan detected problems in exploring all of the posterior. These are **divergent transitions**.

You should also see a second warning:

```
2: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems
```

This refers to Stan’s pairs method, not `ulam`’s.

Let's look at the unhealthy chains:

```{r}
pairs(b9.2, 
      np = brms::nuts_params(b9.2),
      off_diag_args = list(size = 1/4))
```

```{r}
post <- posterior_samples(b9.2, add_chain = T)

p1 <-
  post %>% 
  mcmc_trace(pars = vars(b_Intercept:sigma),
             size = .25)

p2 <-
  post %>% 
  mcmc_rank_overlay(pars = vars(b_Intercept:sigma))

(
  (p1 / p2) &
    scale_color_pomological() &
    theme_pomological_fancy(base_family = "Marck Script") &
    theme(legend.position = "none")
) +
  plot_annotation(subtitle = "These chains are not healthy")
```

They show the chains spend long periods with one chain above or below the others. This indicates poor exploration of the posterior.

It’s easy to tame this particular chain by using weakly informative priors.

b9.4 <-
  brm(data = list(y  = y,
                  a1 = 1,
                  a2 = 1), 
      family = gaussian,
      y ~ 0 + a1 + a2,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 1000), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 3,
