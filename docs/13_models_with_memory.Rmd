Any of the models from previous chapters that used dummy variables to handle categories are programmed for amnesia. These models implicitly assume that nothing learned about any one category informs estimates for the other categories — the parameters are independent of one another and learn from completely separate portions of the data.

Anterograde amnesia is bad for learning about the world.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="In statistical language, they've all been fixed effects models. They have amnesia in that every time you move to a new cluster (indivdual, pond, block), it forgets everything it's seen about the thigns they visited previously. Learning develops expectations and lets us learn. MLMs develop expectations about all clusters in the data. They learn in a way that's invariant to the order that they miight visit them. That's the optimal way to learn. Some metaphors to latch onto..."}

As the robot observes waiting times, it updates everything: the estimates for each café as well as the estimates for the population. If the population seems highly variable, then the prior is flat and uninformative and, as a consequence, the observations at any one café do very little to the estimate at another. If instead the population seems to contain little variation, then the prior is narrow and highly informative. An observation at any one café will have a big impact on estimates at any other café.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Imagine you're visiting some cafes. The experience is largely the same. Here we're contrasting Paris and Berlin. Let's focus on one aspect of ordering - how long you wait for your cofffee. If you've never been to a cafe, you have no expectation of how long it takes. Then you go to Paris, and it takes 5 minutes. Then when you go to Berlin, you don't forget that experience, but you also don't think it's going to be exactly the same. A remmbering model treats a cafe as a population. And you can transfer infomration among units in that population. And that allows for better estaimtes for every cafe. Other thing to think is if it takes 10 minutes in Berlin, you had your 5 mintue prior, you update that with Bayesian updating, but the time order should be irrelevant to your learning. Now you need to update Paris too, because you have a limited sample in Paris, and you've got data from Berlin. So data from both are relevant to updating both of them. "}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="How much information you transfer across depends on how variable they are. You learnn this variance as well. Different metaphor now. In East Africa, one of the strategies for not getting intestinal infections was to carry around a bunch of chillies. These are goat peppers. Their spiciness is quite random. One could be a dud, and the next one will kill you. When estiamting the spiciness of one particular plant, you can use your expectation from the whole population but because the plants are so variable, it's hard to transfer informtaion. It woud be as if with cafes, some give it instantly, others make you wait half an hour, so it's hard to estimate how long you'll wait. This variation is another thing we have to learn."}

In this chapter, you’ll see the formal version of this argument and how it leads us to MULTILEVEL MODELS. These models remember features of each cluster in the data as they learn about all of the clusters. Depending upon the variation among clusters, which is learned from the data as well, the model pools information across clusters. This pooling tends to improve estimates about each cluster. This improved estimation leads to several, more pragmatic sounding, benefits of the multilevel approach. I mentioned them in Chapter 1. They are worth repeating.

1. *Improved estimates for repeat sampling*. When more than one observation arises from the same individual, location, or time, then traditional, single-level models either maximally underfit or overfit the data.

1. *Improved estimates for imbalance in sampling*. When some individuals, locations, or times are sampled more than others, multilevel models automatically cope with differing uncertainty across these clusters. This prevents over-sampled clusters from unfairly dominating inference.

1. *Estimates of variation*. If our research questions include variation among individuals or other groups within the data, then multilevel models are a big help, because they model variation explicitly.

1. *Avoid averaging, retain variation*. Frequently, scholars pre-average some data to construct variables. This can be dangerous, because averaging removes variation, and there are also typically several different ways to perform the averaging. Averaging therefore both manufactures false confidence and introduces arbitrary data transformations. Multilevel models allow us to preserve the uncertainty and avoid data transformations.

It is better to begin to build a multilevel analysis, and then realize it’s unnecessary, than to overlook it.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="In this course, we have to wage our statistical battles on two fronts: causal inference. Avoid causal salad - they typical way it's done. Having a DAG you believe in is a small victory, but not the only thing. Getting precise estimates is a whole separate technology. Today we'll be talking about the second. If we can use the data in more powerful ways, that's what we'll do. "}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="There are some really good defaults. Unfortunately they're not currently. As a default, you should always use multi-level regression. Single-level is always a bad idea. This is my favourite example of defaults. In some countries you are automatically. In others you have to opt in.

VARYING INTERCEPTS are the simplest kind of VARYING EFFECTS. For each cluster, we use a unique intercept parameter.

To get each tank’s expected survival probability, just take one of the a intercept values and then use the logistic transform. So far there is nothing new here.

Now let’s do the multilevel model, which adaptively pools information across tanks. All that is required to enable adaptive pooling is to make the prior for the a parameters a function of some new parameters. 

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now let's try something different. Added some stuff in blue. Let's step through. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '16.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="$\\alpha_j$ is still there. But I've made it into this magical thing called varying intercetps by inserting parameters inside the prior. Where there used to be (0, 1.5). $\\bar{\\alpha}$ is a parameter in and of itself that we're going to estimate. Represents the mean $\\alpha$. Then $\\sigma$, which is the SD in this population. So each $\\alpha_j$ where $j$ is a tank has this prior. Then for these new parameters we have to give them priors. We give $\\bar{\\alpha}$ our regularizing prior, same with $\\sigma$."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '17.png'))
```

$\bar{\alpha}$ and $\sigma$ are **HYPERPARAMETERS**. They create the second level. In the top level, the outcome is $S$, and in the second, the outcome is the vector of intercept parameters, $\alpha$.


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Why would we do this? What are varying intercepts? What's distinctive about this model, and the parameters inside the prior, is that you learn the prior from the data. So we'll regularise because it gives better predictions.

```{r 13.3 b}
b13.2 <- 
  brm(data = d, 
      family = binomial,
      surv | trials(density) ~ 1 + (1 | tank),
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 1.5), class = Intercept),  # bar alpha
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd)),        # sigma

      sample_prior = "yes",
      seed = 13,
      file = "fits/b13.02")
```


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="If you focus on the model structure, you can understand things. If you focus on terminology, you'll get confused. Let's compare these models. Want to show you something about flexibilty in random effects 13.1 is fixed effects. 13.2 is MLM. In terms of WAIC, they're very similar. Not much of a difference. But look at the effective number of parameters. 131. has 48 paramaters because there are 48 tanks. One parameter for each. It ends up with 25 effective. Why? Because of the regularising prior. It wasn't flat. That means there are tank where all the tadploles survived. What's the log-odds of that? Infinite. But because of the piror, you don't end up with an alpha of infinity. What's happening with 13.2 is we've addedd two more parameters  ($\\bar{\\alpha}$ and $\\sigma$). But fewer effective parameters. When teaching you about overfitting, the caveat was that every time you add a paramter the fit in-sample imporoves. *Other than* with MLMs. They learn how regular to be from the data itself. The regularising prior ends up being narrower. One of the coolest facts in statistics. Deep learning works because it's deep. Parameters stacked on parameters.  "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '22.png'))

Compute the WAIC comparisons:

```{r 13.4 b}
b13.1 <- brms::add_criterion(b13.1, "waic")
b13.2 <- brms::add_criterion(b13.2, "waic")

w <- brms::loo_compare(b13.1, b13.2, criterion = "waic")

print(w, simplify = F)
```

The se_diff is small relative to the elpd_diff. If we convert the elpd difference to the WAIC metric, the message stays the same.

```{r}
cbind(waic_diff = w[, 1] * -2,
      se        = w[, 2] *  2)
```

Here are the WAIC weights:
```{r}
brms::model_weights(b13.1, b13.2, weights = "waic") %>% 
  round(digits = 2)
```

Compare number of effective parameters:

```{r}
w[, "p_waic"]
```

```{r}
print(b13.2)
```


There are 28 fewer effective parameters than actual parameters, because the prior assigned to each intercept shrinks them all towards the mean $\bar{\alpha}$. In this case, the prior is reasonably strong. This is a REGULARIZING PRIOR, like you’ve used in previous chapters, but now the amount of regularization has been learned from the data itself.

To appreciate the impact of this adaptive regularization, let’s plot and compare the posterior means from models `m13.1` and `m13.2`. 

```{r 13.5 b}
post <- posterior_samples(b13.2)

post_mdn <- 
  coef(b13.2, robust = T)$tank[, , ] %>%

post_mdn %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tank)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = inv_logit_scaled(median(post$b_Intercept)), linetype = 2, size = 1/4) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(16.5, 32.5), size = 1/4, color = "grey25") +

           x = c(8, 16 + 8, 32 + 8), y = 0, 
           label = c("small tanks", "medium tanks", "large tanks")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 16, 32, 48)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:5 / 5, limits = c(0, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Multilevel shrinkage!",
       subtitle = "The empirical proportions are in orange while the model-\nimplied proportions are the black circles. The dashed line is\nthe model-implied average survival proportion.") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank())
```


First, notice that in every case, the multilevel estimate is closer to the dashed line than the raw empirical estimate is. It’s as if the entire distribution of black circles has been shrunk towards the dashed line at the center of the data, leaving the blue points behind on the outside.

Second, notice that the estimates for the smaller tanks have shrunk farther from the blue points.

Third, note that the farther a blue point is from the dashed line, the greater the distance between it and the corresponding multilevel estimate.

All three of these phenomena arise from a common cause: pooling information across clusters (tanks) to improve estimates.

First we’ll plot 100 Gaussian distributions, one for each of the first 100 samples from the posterior distribution of both α and σ. Then we’ll sample 8000 new log-odds of survival for individual tanks.

The estimate for any particular alpha will be a mix of the data in that tank and all of the other tanks. The mix depends on the variation on the tanks. If there's no variation across tanks, then the whole population is used. If sigma goes to infitnty , you ignore the population."}

***13.2.2. Assign values to the parameters***



I’ve chosen 60 ponds, with 15 each of initial tadpole density 5, 10, 25, and 35. 


Go ahead and inspect the contents of dsim, the simulated data. The first column is the pond index, 1 through 60. The second column is the initial tadpole count in each pond. The third column is the true log-odds survival for each pond.

```{r 13.7b}
a_bar   <-  1.5
sigma   <-  1.5
n_ponds <- 60

set.seed(5005)

dsim <- 
  tibble(pond   = 1:n_ponds,
         ni     = rep(c(5, 10, 25, 35), each = n_ponds / 4) %>% as.integer(),
         true_a = rnorm(n = n_ponds, mean = a_bar, sd = sigma))

head(dsim)

# Plot
dsim %>% 
  mutate(ni = factor(ni)) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = true_a, y = ni)) +
  stat_dotsinterval(fill = "orange2", slab_size = 0, .width = .5) +
  ggtitle("Log-odds varying by # tadpoles per pond") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14))
```


***13.2.3. Simulate survivors***

Now we’re ready to simulate the binomial survival process. Each pond i has ni potential survivors, and nature flips each tadpole’s coin, so to speak, with probability of survival $p_i$.

```{r 13.11 b}
set.seed(5005)

dsim <-
  dsim %>%
  mutate(si = rbinom(n = n(), prob = inv_logit_scaled(true_a), size = ni))

dsim %>% 
  DT::datatable(.)
```


***13.2.4. Compute the no-pooling estimates***

```{r 13.12 b}
dsim <-
  dsim %>%
  mutate(p_nopool = si / ni)

dsim %>% 
  DT::datatable(.)
```


***13.2.5. Compute the partial-pooling estimates***


```{r 13.13 b}
b13.3 <- 
  brms::brm(data = dsim, 
            family = binomial,
            si | trials(ni) ~ 1 + (1 | pond),
            prior = c(prior(normal(0, 1.5), class = Intercept),
                      prior(exponential(1), class = sd)),
            iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
            seed = 13,
            file = "fits/b13.03")

print(b13.3)
```



Take a look at the estimates for $\bar{\alpha}$ and $\sigma$.

```{r 13.14 b}
b13.3$fit
```


Compute the survival proportions and add them to our growing simulation data frame.

```{r}
# we could have included this step in the block of code below, if we wanted to
p_partpool <- 
  coef(b13.3)$pond[, , ] %>% 
  data.frame() %>%
  transmute(p_partpool = inv_logit_scaled(Estimate))

dsim <- 
  dsim %>%
  bind_cols(p_partpool) %>% 
  mutate(p_true = inv_logit_scaled(true_a)) %>%
  mutate(nopool_error   = abs(p_nopool   - p_true),
         partpool_error = abs(p_partpool - p_true))

dsim %>% 
  glimpse()
```

Compare to the true per-pond survival probabilities.


Now plot


```{r 13.18 b}
dfline <- 
  dsim %>%
  dplyr::select(ni, nopool_error:partpool_error) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(-ni) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(name, ni) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean_error = mean(value)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(x    = c( 1, 16, 31, 46),
                xend = c(15, 30, 45, 60))
  
dsim %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pond)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(15.5, 30.5, 45.4), 
             color = "white", size = 2/3) +
  geom_point(aes(y = nopool_error), color = "orange2") +
  geom_point(aes(y = partpool_error), shape = 1) +
  geom_segment(data = dfline, 
               aes(x = x, xend = xend, 
                   y = mean_error, yend = mean_error),
               color = rep(c("orange2", "black"), each = 4),
               linetype = rep(1:2, each = 4)) +
  annotate(geom = "text", 
           x = c(15 - 7.5, 30 - 7.5, 45 - 7.5, 60 - 7.5), y = .45, 
           label = c("tiny (5)", "small (10)", "medium (25)", "large (35)")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)) +
  labs(title = "Estimate error by model type",
       subtitle = "The horizontal axis displays pond number. The vertical axis measures\nthe absolute error in the predicted proportion of survivors, compared to\nthe true value used in the simulation. The higher the point, the worse\nthe estimate. No-pooling shown in orange. Partial pooling shown in black.\nThe orange and dashed black lines show the average error for each kind\nof estimate, across each initial density of tadpoles (pond size).",
       y = "absolute error") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10))
```

Or quantify the difference in simple summaries:
```{r}
dsim %>%
  dplyr::select(ni, nopool_error:partpool_error) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(-ni) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(name) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean_error   = mean(value) %>% round(digits = 3),
            median_error = median(value) %>% round(digits = 3))
```


Once you've compiled `m13.3` once, you can use this code to re-simulate ponds and sample from the new posterior, without waiting for the model to compile again:



```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="On the left we have tiny ponds. The blue points are the raw proportions survived. The open points are the partial pooling estimates. The error is the absolute error from the true value. 0 is totally correct. A lot of error here because you've only got 5 tadpoles.

They're not perfect, but they're better. THis is all shrinkage. "}

```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap=""}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '36.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="The other tanks. The pattern holds as you go across. The amount of error declines, because we have more data. The difference, the advantage of MLMs, shrinks. But still estimates the popualtion, which is important for prediction.

**Overthinking::repeating the pond simulation**

```

## More than one type of cluster

We can use and often should use more than one type of cluster in the same model. Each pull is within a cluster of pulls belonging to an individual chimpanzee. But each pull is also within an experimental block, which represents a collection of observations that happened on the same day.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Experiment with a small number of chimps. Replicated on each. 4 treatments with prosocial option. Question is do they intepret it that way? "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '02.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Want to use it to learn how to build a more complex vasrying effects model when we have more than one type of cluster. Called cross-classfication. The indivdual chimps are cross-classified, as is experimental day. In this dataset everything is balanced. All the chimps in all the blocks. Going to use both these types of clusters. Actors is a clsuter so we can estimate parameters specific to the chimp, like handedness. Also have repeated observations inside blocks. You can just design them liek a varying intercept model. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '03.png'))
```

***13.3.1. Multilevel chimpanzees***


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Here's the MLM with both actor and block intercepts. Alpha for each actor, gamma for each block, and beta for each treatment. Ordinary fixed effects, regularising, not adaptive. Just like tank effects. Interpretation is the handedness. Adaptive prior, with alpha bar. And a sigma alpha. So the model will learn the prior from the data."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '04.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Then another adaptive prior, gamma for each block. It's conditional on each parameter. No gamma bar. You could put it there, but it would be redundant. Could just put a 0 there. Hyperpriors at the bottom. Blue bits are the block. You can extend this strategy for as many cluster types as you like. "}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Just a logistic regression with a bunch of stuff. `a[actor]`. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '06.png'))
```


In this case, you should see a warning about DIVERGENT TRANSITIONS. In the next section, I’ll show you how to fix this. For now, we can keep moving and interpret the posterior.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="`a` for each actor. Vector of those. They each have a common prior, with two parameters inside it. Conditional on other parameters (which makes it adaptive.) Then at the bottom it gives it shape. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '07.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Same thing for blocks. Block in the model, black adaptive prior, then sigma. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '08.png'))
```

This is easily the most complicated model we’ve used in the book so far. So let’s look at the posterior and take note of a few important features:

```{r 13.21 b}
data(chimpanzees, package = "rethinking")
d <- chimpanzees
rm(chimpanzees)

d <-
  d %>% 
  mutate(actor     = factor(actor),
         block     = factor(block),
         treatment = factor(1 + prosoc_left + 2 * condition))

glimpse(d)

b13.4 <- 
  brm(data = d, 
      family = binomial,
      bf(pulled_left | trials(1) ~ a + b,
         a ~ 1 + (1 | actor) + (1 | block), 
         b ~ 0 + treatment,
         nl = TRUE),
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.5), nlpar = b),
                prior(normal(0, 1.5), class = b, coef = Intercept, nlpar = a),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd, group = actor, nlpar = a),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd, group = block, nlpar = a)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 13,
      file = "fits/b13.04")
```


Check the trace plots:

```{r}
bayesplot::color_scheme_set("orange")

post <- brms::posterior_samples(b13.4, add_chain = T)

post %>% 
  bayesplot::mcmc_trace(pars = vars(-iter, -lp__),
                        facet_args = list(ncol = 4), 
                        size = .15) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r}
print(b13.4)
```

```{r}
posterior_summary(b13.4) %>% round(digits = 2)
```


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Run this model at home. WOn't encounter any problems. Plot the precis on the left. Treatment parameters. No new story here.

```

```{r 13.22 b}
mcmc_plot(b13.4, pars = c("^r_", "^b_", "^sd_")) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0))
```
Now use `post` to compare the group-level $\sigma$ parameters:

```{r}
post %>%
  pivot_longer(starts_with("sd")) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = name)) +
  geom_density(size = 0, alpha = 3/4, adjust = 2/3, show.legend = F) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 0.67, y = 2, label = "block", color = "orange4") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 2.725, y = 0.5, label = "actor", color = "orange1") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = str_c("orange", c(1, 4))) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  ggtitle(expression(sigma["<group>"])) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 4))
```


First, notice that the number of effective samples, `n_eff`, varies quite a lot across parameters. This is common in complex models. Why? There are many reasons for this. But in this sort of model a common reason is that some parameter spends a lot of time near a boundary. Here, that parameter is `sigma_g.` It spends a lot of time near its minimum of zero. Some Rhat values are also slightly above 1.00 now. All of this is a sign of inefficient sampling, which we’ll fix in the next section.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Natural to ask then, should we even have varying intercepts on block. Doesn't matter. Leave them out and get the same inference. Nice feature of varying effects is if there's not much vasriation, not harmful to add varying effects. Here's the same model, but we've taken out the block effects entirely, but with varying intercepts on individuals, and can compare with WAIC or LOO, and see that they're very similar models. Effectively the same. Notice the parameter counts have a small difference. 2 effective parameter difference, even though it has 7 more parameters. Lots of machine learning works this way.  "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '10.png'))
```

```{r 13.23 b}
b13.5 <- 
  brm(data = d, 
      family = binomial,
      bf(pulled_left | trials(1) ~ a + b,
         a ~ 1 + (1 | actor), 
         b ~ 0 + treatment,
         nl = TRUE),
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.5), nlpar = b),
                prior(normal(0, 1.5), class = b, coef = Intercept, nlpar = a),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd, group = actor, nlpar = a)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 13,
      file = "fits/b13.05")
```

Compare WAICs

```{r 13.24 b}
b13.4 <- add_criterion(b13.4, "waic")
b13.5 <- add_criterion(b13.5, "waic")

loo_compare(b13.4, b13.5, criterion = "waic") %>% 
  print(simplify = F)

model_weights(b13.4, b13.5, weights = "waic") %>% 
  round(digits = 2)
```


There is nothing to gain here by selecting either model. The comparison of the two models tells a richer story—whether we include block or not hardly matters, and the g and sigma_g estimates tell us why.

***13.3.2. Even more clusters***

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Let's add some more random effects. Synonym of varying effects. Rnadom has a tendency to interpret effects in a stronger way. Just a statistcal way to regularise inference. Source of clusters is irrelevant to whethr to add random effects or not. Wnat to regularise, but not adaptively. If you care about mroe accurate inferences, use adaptive priors. All we have ot do is add a sigma beta. Give it a parameter and we learn it. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '11.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="One more sigma down the bottom. Run it and compare to the preivous. They're basiclaly the same estimates. Why? Because there's tonnes of data per treatment. It trims the posterior uncertainty a little bit, but doesn't change the effective inference."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '12.png'))
```

```{r 13.25 b}
b13.6 <- 
  brm(data = d, 
      family = binomial,
      pulled_left | trials(1) ~ 1 + (1 | actor) + (1 | block) + (1 | treatment),
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 1.5), class = Intercept),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sd)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,  
      seed = 13,
      file = "fits/b13.06")

# Compare coefficients
tibble(parameter = str_c("b[", 1:4, "]"),
       `b13.4`   = fixef(b13.4)[2:5, 1],
       `b13.6`   = ranef(b13.6)$treatment[, 1, "Intercept"]) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.double, round, digits = 2)
```


And there is a lot of data in each treatment, so they don’t get pooled much in any event. If you compare model m13.6 with m13.4, using either WAIC or PSIS, you’ll see they are no different on purely predictive criteria. This is the typical result, when each cluster (each treatment here) has a lot of data to inform its parameters.

Compare group-level $\sigma$ parameters with a plot:

```{r}
posterior_samples(b13.6) %>% 
  pivot_longer(starts_with("sd")) %>% 
  mutate(group = str_remove(name, "sd_") %>% str_remove(., "__Intercept")) %>% 
  mutate(parameter = str_c("sigma[", group,"]")) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = parameter)) +
  stat_halfeye(.width = .95, size = 1, fill = "orange", adjust = 0.1) +
  scale_y_discrete(labels = ggplot2:::parse_safe) +
  labs(subtitle = "The variation among treatment levels is small, but the\nvariation among the levels of block is still the smallest.") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1.5, 3)) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0))
```

Now compare `b13.6` with the last two models:

```{r}
b13.6 <- add_criterion(b13.6, "waic")

brms::loo_compare(b13.4, b13.5, b13.6, criterion = "waic") %>% 
  print(simplify = F)

model_weights(b13.4, b13.5, b13.6, weights = "loo") %>% 
  round(digits = 2)
```


## Divergent transitions and non-centered priors

In a purely mathematical system, the energy is always conserved correctly. It’s just a fact about the physics.

But in a numerical system, it might not be. Sometimes the total energy is not the same at the end as it was at the start. In these cases, the energy is divergent. How can this happen? It tends to happen when the posterior distribution is very steep in some region of parameter space. Steep changes in probability are hard for a discrete physics simulation to follow. When that happens, the algorithm notices by comparing the energy at the start to the energy at the end. When they don’t match, it indicates numerical problems exploring that part of the posterior distribution.

Divergent transitions are rejected. They don’t directly damage your approximation of the posterior distribution. But they do hurt it indirectly, because the region where divergent transitions happen is hard to explore correctly. And even when there aren’t any divergent transitions, distributions with steep regions are hard to explore. The chains will be less efficient. And unfortunately this happens quite often in multilevel models.

There are two easy tricks for reducing the impact of divergent transitions. The first is to tune the simulation so that it doesn’t overshoot the valley wall. This means doing more warmup with a higher target acceptance rate, Stan’s adapt_delta. But for many models, you can never tune the sampler enough to remove the divergent transitions. The second trick is to write the statistical model in a new way, to REPARAMETERIZE it.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="You will get these warnings. Divergent transitions. They are your friend, in the sense that they are telling you something numerically inefficient about ht emodel. Easy to get rid of them. Teaches you someting really important. Even though mathematiclaly equivalent, the Markvov Chain will see them as quite different. Need to swtich between different ways of writing the same model. Gives you advice to increase `adapt_delta`. But sometimes that won't save you, and you just need to re-parameterise the modeo."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '13.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Imagine you're on a frictionless rollercoaster. As it moves from A to D, there are two forms of energy. The energy is in two buckets. Start at A and going to B, it lost potential gravitational energy, and is converted to kinetic energy, to motion. Then as it goes from B to C, that conversion goes the other way. Then C to D, and will do it again. The sum of those two things is constant in a frictionless system."}

All is well. If you plot x against v, you will see the funnel. We managed to sample it by sampling a different variable and then transforming it.

***13.4.2. Non-centered chimpanzees***

Before reparameterizing, the first thing you can try is to increase Stan’s target acceptance rate. This is controlled by the `adapt_delta` control parameter. The ulam default is 0.95, which means that it aims to attain a 95% acceptance rate. It tries this during the warmup phase, adjusting the step size of each leapfrog step (go back to Chapter 9 if these terms aren’t familiar). When adapt_delta is set high, it results in a smaller step size, which means a more accurate approximation of the curved surface. It can also mean slower exploration of the distribution.

Increasing `adapt_delta` will often, but not always, help with divergent transitions. 

So that did help. But sometimes this won’t be enough. And while the divergent transitions are gone, the chain still isn’t very efficient — look at the `precis` output and notice that many of the `n_eff` values are still far below the true number of samples (2000 in this case: 4 chains, 500 from each).

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="This is what it looks like in a real model. As before, it's a centered model because it has paramters insdie the adaptive priors. And it sampled fine. But if we de-center it, it'll be more efficient.  "}

All but two parameters lie above the diagonal, indicating better sampling for the non-centered parameterization.

## Multilevel posterior predictions

***13.5.1. Posterior prediction for same clusters***

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Last thing to talk about is how to do posterior predictions. You have to make some choices. You get to decide how to think about the generalisation of the model. The most direct way to consider the choices is, when you generalise inferences, are you interested in new units, or the same chimps. If you interested in new ones, you wouldn't get to use the alphas. However the other parameters are definitely relevant, because you've learned about the variation in a popoulation of chimps, which would give you a prior. So here's an example."}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Let's consider. Different ways to draw this. Take the statsitically average chimpanzee, and ask what the nmodel says it owuld do.

Then show the sample of actors fromt eh posterior."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '32.png'))
```

***13.5.1. Posterior prediction for same clusters***

Construct posterior predictions with a link function and compute predictions:

```{r}
chimp <- 2

nd <-
  d %>% 
  distinct(treatment) %>% 
  mutate(actor = chimp,
         block = 1)

labels <- c("R/N", "L/N", "R/P", "L/P")

f <-
  fitted(b13.4,
         newdata = nd) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  bind_cols(nd) %>% 
  mutate(treatment = factor(treatment, labels = labels))

f
```

Empirical probabilities computed directly from the data (i.e. no pooling)
```{r}
chimp_2_d <-
  d %>% 
  filter(actor == chimp) %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>% 
  summarise(prob = mean(pulled_left)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(treatment = factor(treatment, labels = labels))

chimp_2_d
```

And the corresponding plot:
```{r}
f %>%
  # if you want to use `geom_line()` or `geom_ribbon()` with a factor on the x-axis,
  # you need to code something like `group = 1` in `aes()`
  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = Estimate, group = 1)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = Q2.5, ymax = Q97.5), fill = "orange1") +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(data = chimp_2_d,
             aes(y = prob),
             color = "grey25") +
  ggtitle("Chimp #2",
          subtitle = "The posterior mean and 95%\nintervals are the blue line\nand orange band, respectively.\nThe empirical means are\nthe charcoal dots.") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(.75, 1)) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10))
```

Extract the posterior samples and look at the structure of the data:

```{r}
post <- posterior_samples(b13.4)

glimpse(post)
```

```{r 13.33 b}
post %>%
  transmute(actor_5 = `r_actor__a[5,Intercept]`) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = actor_5)) +
  geom_density(size = 0, fill = "blue") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  ggtitle("Chimp #5's density")
```

```{r 13.35}
f <-
  post %>% 
  pivot_longer(b_b_treatment1:b_b_treatment4) %>% 
  mutate(fitted = inv_logit_scaled(b_a_Intercept + value + `r_actor__a[1,Intercept]` + `r_block__a[1,Intercept]`)) %>% 
  mutate(treatment = factor(str_remove(name, "b_b_treatment"),
                            labels = labels)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(name:treatment)

f
```

Now summarise:

```{r 13.35 b}
# the posterior summaries
(
  f <-
  f %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  tidybayes::mean_qi(fitted)
)
```


```{r}
# the empirical summaries
chimp <- 5

(
  chimp_5_d <-
  d %>% 
  filter(actor == chimp) %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>% 
  summarise(prob = mean(pulled_left)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(treatment = factor(treatment, labels = labels))
)
```


Now see how good at retrodicting the `pulled_left` probabilities for `actor == 5`:
```{r}
f %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = fitted, group = 1)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = .lower, ymax = .upper), fill = "orange1") +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(data = chimp_5_d,
             aes(y = prob),
             color = "grey25") +
  ggtitle("Chimp #5",
          subtitle = "This plot is like the last except\nwe did more by hand.") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = 0:1) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10))
```


***13.5.2. Posterior prediction for new clusters***

One way to grasp the task of constructing posterior predictions for new clusters is to imagine leaving out one of the clusters when you fit the model to the data. For example, suppose we leave out actor number 7 when we fit the chimpanzees model. Now how can we assess the model’s accuracy for predicting actor number 7’s behavior? We can’t use any of the a parameter estimates, because those apply to other individuals. But we can make good use of the a_bar and sigma_a parameters. These parameters describe a statistical population of actors, and we can simulate new actors from it.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Chimp with alpha bar. All we have to do is replace all the intercepts with 0, then we can use link. Extract the samples, then put in a big matrix of 0s and run the link. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '33.png'))
```


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Here's the average actor. There's uncertainty about it. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '34.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now we have to create a prediction interval for all chimps. There's uncretainty re: handedness, which makes it wider."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '35.png'))
```

To show the variation among actors, we’ll need to use sigma_a in the calculation. 


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Why wider? Because chimps vary a lto. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '36.png'))
```




```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Finally, sample a bunch of chimps and draw them. One of the things that happens is because there's a posterior distribution for each parameter, the model things it's possible to get completely right-handed chimps. But the treatment effect is still there. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '37.png'))
```

```{r 13.37 b}
f <-
  post %>% 
  pivot_longer(b_b_treatment1:b_b_treatment4) %>%

                                   labels = labels)) %>%

***13.5.3. Post-stratification***

A common problem is how to use a non-representative sample of a population to generate representative predictions for the same population. For example, we might survey potential voters, asking about their voting intentions. Such samples are biased—different groups respond to such surveys at different rates. So if we just use the survey average, we’ll make the wrong prediction about the election. How can we do better?
One technique is POST-STRATIFICATION.

How does it work? Supposing you have estimates $p_i$ for each demographic category $i$, then the post-stratified prediction for the whole population (not the sample) just re-weights these estimates using the number of individuals $N_i$ in each category:

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Focus on the variation that adds to the tanks. Look at the sigma across different models, and there will be a pattern. The second dataset is a historical Bangladeshi dataset. Also will be a varying interecepts model, but now youll be exploring shrinkage. "}
