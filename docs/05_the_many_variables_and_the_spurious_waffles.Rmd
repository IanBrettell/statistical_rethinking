```



```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "We have here a plausible graph. How does A affect M? If the young are getting married too, then more people are getting married.

`|` means "conditional on".


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Already know how to do these, just need to do extra stuff. Linear regression is a special type of Bayesian network where there's an outcome variable, which is assigned Gaussian probability with some mean that is conditional based on some variable, and a standard deviation. The `i`s are states. Have some intercepts. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '14.png'))
```


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Have to think harder about priors now. It help a lot by standardising the priors - converting them into Z-scores. If you make all your variables z-scores, you make you life easier. (But not in all cases.) When you standardise your predictors, you're setting your mean as 0. The regression line has to go through 0, and so alpha should be 0, We'll give it a Gaussian prior with a tight SD. Maybe should even be tighter. Slopes are a little harder. You don't want to use flat priors because you don't want it to think wildly impossible slopes are possible to start. That's why we do some prior predictive simulation."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '15.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "You can fit your model. You can run that model. `extract.prior` samples from the prior to simulate. Then pass it to `link` to create predictions based on the prior. Then you can plot the regression lines. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '16.png'))
```
If $\beta_A = 1$, that would imply that a change of one standard deviation in age at marriage is associated with a change of one standard deviation in divorce.

To know if that's strong, how big is a standard deviation of age at marriage?

```{r 5.2}
sd( d$MedianAgeMarriage )
```


```{r 5.3, results = "hide"}
b5.1 <- 
  brm(data = d, 
      family = gaussian,
      d ~ 1 + a,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 5,
      sample_prior = T,
      file = "fits/b05.01")
```

`sample_prior = T` tells `brms` to take draws from both the posterior distribution (as usual) and from the prior predictive distribution. 

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "This is 50 regression lines from the prior. Standardised deviation of marriage. 2 SD is almost all. If your model thinks a possible divorce rate is outside the observable range of divorce rates, then they're bad. This prior allows really strong relationships. Allows it to govern nearly all the variation in divorce rate. But we'll move forward with this. This is the flattest prior you could justify scientifically. Priors by frequentists consider even crazier priors, just as vertical lines."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '17.png'))
```

```{r 5.4}
prior <- prior_samples(b5.1)

prior %>% glimpse()

set.seed(5)

prior %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 50) %>% 
  rownames_to_column("draw") %>% 
  expand(nesting(draw, Intercept, b),
         a = c(-2, 2)) %>% 
  mutate(d = Intercept + b * a) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = d)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = draw),
            color = "firebrick", alpha = .4) +
  labs(x = "Median age marriage (std)",
       y = "Divorce rate (std)") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 2)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) 
```

Now for the posterior predictions:

```{r 5.5}
# determine the range of `a` values we'd like to feed into `fitted()`
nd <- tibble(a = seq(from = -3, to = 3.2, length.out = 30))

# now use `fitted()` to get the model-implied trajectories
fitted(b5.1,
       newdata = nd) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  bind_cols(nd) %>% 
  
  # plot
  ggplot(aes(x = a)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = Estimate, ymin = Q2.5, ymax = Q97.5),
              stat = "identity",
              fill = "firebrick", color = "firebrick4", alpha = 1/5, size = 1/4) +
  geom_point(data = d, 
             aes(y = d), 
             size = 2, color = "firebrick4") +
  labs(x = "Median age marriage (std)",
       y = "Divorce rate (std)") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = range(d$a), 
                  ylim = range(d$d)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) 
```
$\beta_A$ is reliably negative. 

```{r}
print(b5.1)
```


You can fit a similar regression for the relationship in the left-hand plot:

```{r 5.6, results = "hide"}
b5.2 <- 
  brm(data = d, 
      family = gaussian,
      d ~ 1 + m,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 5,
      file = "fits/b05.02")

```

```{r}
print(b5.2)
```

Make the left-hand panel

```{r}
nd <- tibble(m = seq(from = -2.5, to = 3.5, length.out = 30))

fitted(b5.2, newdata = nd) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  bind_cols(nd) %>%

  geom_point(data = d, 
             aes(y = d),

      d ~ 1 + m + a,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),

```
Here's the quap code, and we get a table of coefficients. Look for the mean, and as I promised, $\alpha$ is 0. ``bM` is about twice the size of the posterior value itself. No consistent relationship. Age of marriage however, is -.6, but now the posterior mass is entirely below 0. What's the lesson here? There's probably no causal relationship between marriage rate and divorce, and that's because it was confounded by age of marriage. 


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "This shows all three models. Bottom is age of marriage only. The one with marriage rates in the middle. Then marriage rate and and age of marriage in the bottom."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '20.png'))

You have to be clear about whether you're interesting in predicting things, or understanding the true nature of things. 

Let's simulate the divorce example. Every DAG implies a simulation, and such simulations can help us design models to correctly infer relationships among variables.

```{r 5.12}
# how many states would you like?
n <- 50 

set.seed(5)
sim_d <-
  tibble(age = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)) %>%  # sim A 
  mutate(mar = rnorm(n, mean = -age, sd = 1),   # sim A -> M 
         div = rnorm(n, mean =  age, sd = 1))   # sim A -> D

head(sim_d)
```

```{r}
pairs(sim_d, col = "firebrick4")
```



***5.1.5 Plotting multivariate posteriors***

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "How do we visualise models like this? Lots of ways. Usually the most useful way to visualise depends on the model. You want to think about what you're trying to communicate. The first are predictor residual plots, not that you need to do them, but good for understanding how these linear regressions works."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '22.png'))
```

*5.1.5.1 Predictor residual plots*

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Purpose is to show how the association looks, having controlled for the other predictors. We want to calculate the intermediate states. Great for intuition but terrible for analysis. Never any statistical justification for running regression over residuals. Why? Gives you the wrong answer, because it gives you bias estimates. What to do instead? Multiple regressions."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '23.png'))
```

Recipe:

1. Regress a predictor, and find the extra variance left over, and look at the pattern of the relationship between the residuals and the outcome.

Goals:
1. Figure out whether the approximation of the posterior works. Compare the predictions with the raw data. If they're different, they fail. 
2. It can inspire you to look at the cases that don't fit well, and figure out what you need to make better causal inferences.



Plot predictions against observed.

*5.1.5.3 Counterfactual plots*

They can be produced for any values of the predictor variables you like, even unobserved combinations like high median age of marriage and high marriage rate.

Used with clarity of purpose, counterfactual plots help you understand the model, as well as generate predictions for imaginary interventions and compute how much some observed outcome could be attributed to some cause. 

Recipe:
1. Pick a variable to manipulate (the intervention variable)
2. Define the range of values to set the intervention variable to.
3. For each value of the intervention variable, and for each sample in posterior, use the causal model to simulate the values of other variables, including the outcome. 

```{r 5.19, results = "hide"}
d_model <- bf(d ~ 1 + a + m)
m_model <- bf(m ~ 1 + a)

b5.3_A <-

      d_model + m_model + set_rescor(FALSE),

                prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept, resp = m),
                prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b, resp = m),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma, resp = m)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 5,
      file = "fits/b05.03_A")

             m = 0)

          resp = "d",
          newdata = nd) %>%

Now simulate what would happen if we manipulate A.

       x = "manipulated A",
       y = "counterfactual M") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 2)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) 

p1 + p2 + plot_annotation(title = "Counterfactual plots for the multivariate divorce model")
```

```{r}
# new data frame, standardized to mean 26.1 and std dev 1.24 
nd <- tibble(a = (c(20, 30) - 26.1) / 1.24,
             m = 0)

predict(b5.3_A,
        resp = "d",
        newdata = nd,
        summary = F) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  set_names("a20", "a30") %>% 
  mutate(difference = a30 - a20) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(difference))
```


This is a huge effect of 4.5 standard deviations, probably impossibly large.

Now let's simulate the effect of manipulating $M$. It's like a perfectly controlled experiment. We'll simulate a counterfactual for an average state, with $A = 0$, and see what changing $M$ does.

```{r 5.24}
nd <- tibble(m = seq(from = -2, to = 2, length.out = 30),
             a = 0)

predict(b5.3_A,
        resp = "d",
        newdata = nd) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  bind_cols(nd) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = m, y = Estimate, ymin = Q2.5, ymax = Q97.5)) +
  geom_smooth(stat = "identity",
              fill = "firebrick", color = "firebrick4", alpha = 1/5, size = 1/4) +
  labs(subtitle = "Total counterfactual effect of M on D",
       x = "manipulated M",
       y = "counterfactual D") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 2)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) 
```


Note that we only simulated $D$ now. We don't simulate $A$, because $M$ doesn't influence it. 

**Simulating counterfactuals**

Define a range of values that we want to assign to $A$ and extract the posterior samples:

```{r 5.25}
post <-
  brms::as_draws_df(b5.3_A) %>% 
  mutate(iter = 1:n())
```


```{r 5.26}
post <-
  post %>% 
  expand(nesting(iter, b_m_Intercept, b_m_a, sigma_m, b_d_Intercept, b_d_a, b_d_m, sigma_d),
         a = seq(from = -2, to = 2, length.out = 30)) %>% 
  mutate(m_sim = rnorm(n(), mean = b_m_Intercept + b_m_a * a, sd = sigma_m)) %>% 
  mutate(d_sim = rnorm(n(), mean = b_d_Intercept + b_d_a * a + b_d_m * m_sim, sd = sigma_d)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(ends_with("sim")) %>% 
  group_by(a, name) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(value),
            ll = quantile(value, prob = .025),
            ul = quantile(value, prob = .975))

# what did we do?
head(post)
```



If you plot `A_seq` against the column means of `D_sim`, you'll see the same result as before. 

```{r}
post %>% 
  mutate(dv = if_else(name == "d_sim", "predictions for D", "predictions for M")) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = mean, ymin = ll, ymax = ul)) +
  geom_smooth(stat = "identity",
              fill = "firebrick", color = "firebrick4", alpha = 1/5, size = 1/4) +
  labs(title = "Hand-made counterfactual plots for the multivariate divorce model",
       x = "manipulated A",
       y = "counterfactual") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 2)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~ dv)
```


## Masked relationship

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Another good thing regression can do is reveal spurious correlations. When there are two predictors that both influence the outcome in different directions, you can get the total causal effect between the two. This tends to arise where you have two predictors, and they act in different directions, and cancel each other out, so if you don't model both of them individually, it looks like they have no effect. Noise can also cause you not to see a relationship."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '33.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Relationship between milk energy and how brainy they are? Intersted in things that are interested in what makes us unique. Primates are mammals, and some mammals have very highly energetic milk, like seals basically ooze butter. Primates in contrast carry their offspring on them. As a consequence, the energy density is lower. Human milk is not energetically rich. 75% of our brain mass is neocortex. Then the brainiest primate is *Cebus*. Can we see a signal of selection on milk energy from braininess?"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '34.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Sample of primate species. Pairs plot. Particularly strong correlation between the magnitude of body mass (log(mass)) is strongly correlated with neocortex. No particular strong relationship between `log(mass)` and `kcal.per.g`."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '35.png'))
```

```{r 5.28}
data(milk, package = "rethinking")
d <- milk
rm(milk)

glimpse(d)
```

```{r}
d %>% 
  dplyr::select(kcal.per.g, mass, neocortex.perc) %>% 
  pairs(col = "firebrick4")
```


As before, standardising helps us both get a reliable approximation of the posterior as well as build reasonable priors.

```{r 5.29}
d <-
  d %>% 
  mutate(kcal.per.g_s     = (kcal.per.g - mean(kcal.per.g)) / sd(kcal.per.g), 
         log_mass_s       = (log(mass) - mean(log(mass))) / sd(log(mass)), 
         neocortex.perc_s = (neocortex.perc - mean(neocortex.perc, na.rm = T)) / sd(neocortex.perc, na.rm = T)
         )
```

Let's first just try to run this as a quap model with some vague priors:

```{r, 5.30}
b5.5_draft <- 
  brm(data = d, 
      family = gaussian,
      kcal.per.g_s ~ 1 + neocortex.perc_s,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 1), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 5,
      sample_prior = T,
      file = "fits/b05.05_draft")
```

The culprit is the missing values in `N`. 

Here we'll just drop the missing values, known as **complete case analysis**. But it isn't always a good thing - see Chapter 15.

```{r 5.32}
dcc <- 
  d %>%
  drop_na(ends_with("_s"))

# how many rows did we drop?
nrow(d) - nrow(dcc)
```

Now let's model with that.

```{r 5.33}
b5.5_draft <- 
  brm(data = dcc, 
      family = gaussian,
      kcal.per.g_s ~ 1 + neocortex.perc_s,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 1), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 1), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 5,
      sample_prior = T,
      file = "fits/b05.05_draft")
```

Simulate and plot 50 prior regression lines.
```{r 5.34}
set.seed(5)

prior_samples(b5.5_draft) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 50) %>% 
  rownames_to_column() %>% 
  expand(nesting(rowname, Intercept, b),
         neocortex.perc_s = c(-2, 2)) %>% 
  mutate(kcal.per.g_s = Intercept + b * neocortex.perc_s) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = neocortex.perc_s, y = kcal.per.g_s)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = rowname),
            color = "firebrick", alpha = .4) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-2, 2)) +
  labs(x = "neocortex percent (std)",
       y = "kilocal per g (std)",
       subtitle = "Intercept ~ dnorm(0, 1)\nb ~ dnorm(0, 1)") +
  theme_bw() +

**Simulating a masking relationship**

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Fake data that causes this relationship. `U` is unobserved, some life history variable. Then the causal influence on each of those. This relationship is sufficient to create what we saw."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '40.png'))
```

```{r}
# how many cases would you like?
n <- 100

set.seed(5)
d_sim <- 
  tibble(m = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)) %>% 
  mutate(n = rnorm(n, mean = m, sd = 1)) %>% 
  mutate(k = rnorm(n, mean = n - m, sd = 1))
```

Get a sense of what we just simulated:

```{r}
d_sim %>% 
  GGally::ggpairs(upper = list(continuous = GGally::wrap("cor", family = "sans", color = "firebrick4")),
          diag  = list(continuous = my_diag),
          lower = list(continuous = my_lower)) +

        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white"))
```


## Categorical variables

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Often we have data that represents discrete categories. Want to include those, but they're not continuous. Useful variables because the mean varies, but can't add them as they are. First is to create a dummy, and the next is almost always superior, and that's the index. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '41.png'))
```

```{r 5.45}
data(Howell1, package = "rethinking")
d <- Howell1
rm(Howell1)

d %>% 
  glimpse()
```

`male` is an indicator, or dummy, variable.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Take a categorical variable and convert them to indicator variables. They stand in for something. e.g. Kalahari height data, `0` means not `male`. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '42.png'))
```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Height varies by sex, so you could include it in the model. The linear model looks like a continuous predictor, because you've coded it as 0 and 1, if effectively turns the parameter off and on, and adjusts the mean. Effectively makes two intercepts, one male, one female. `alpha` is the intercept for females, and `alpha + betaM` is the intercept for males. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '43.png'))
```

```{r 5.46}
set.seed(5)

prior <-
  tibble(mu_female = rnorm(1e4, mean = 178, sd = 20)) %>% 
  mutate(mu_male = mu_female + rnorm(1e4, mean = 0, sd = 10))

prior %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(value),
            sd   = sd(value),
            ll   = quantile(value, prob = .025),
            ul   = quantile(value, prob = .975)) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.double, round, digits = 2)
```

Visualise the two prior predictive distributions:
```{r}
prior %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = name, color = name)) +
  geom_density(size = 2/3, alpha = 2/3) +

  scale_color_manual(NULL, values = c("firebrick4", "black")) +

  xlab("prior predictive distribution for our dummy groups") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        legend.position = c(.82, .83))
```


```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap =  "Have to pick same number of priors for number of categories. Consequence is you end up assuming that one of the categories is less certain than all the others."}

```

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "This is the better option."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '45.png'))
```

```{r 5.47}
d <-
  d %>% 
  mutate(sex = ifelse(male == 1, 2, 1))

head(d)
```

Make it a factor:

```{r}
d <-
  d %>% 
  mutate(sex = factor(sex))
```

***5.3.2. Many categories***

```{r 5.50}

# standardize the `kcal.per.g` variable

b5.9 <- 
  brm(data = d,

      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b),

```{r 5.53}
# Randomly assign these primates to some made up categories

set.seed(63)
d <-
  d %>% 
  mutate(house = sample(rep(houses, each = 8), size = n()))
```

```{r 5.54, results = "hide"}
# Now include these categories as another predictor in the model
b5.10 <- 
  brm(data = d, 
      family = gaussian,
      kcal.per.g_s ~ 0 + clade + house,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 5,
      file = "fits/b05.10")
```

```{r}
print(b5.10)
```

Notice we lost the first category of the second variable. This is because with **brms** formula syntax `<criterion> ~ 0 + <index variable>`, it only works with one index variable. 

Here's the fix:
```{r, results = "hide"}
b5.11 <- 
  brm(data = d,

      bf(kcal.per.g_s ~ 0 + a + h,

         nl = TRUE),
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.5), nlpar = a),
                prior(normal(0, 0.5), nlpar = h),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
