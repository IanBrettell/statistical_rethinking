```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Last week was all about varying intercepts, the simplest type of MLM. Pooling estimates are biased estimators, but they're better than unbiased ones. One datapoint is an unbiased estimate of the mean, but it's probably not good to estimate it based on that. But being biased, we get better estimates out of sample. We can extend this strategy to slopes. Slopes are treatment effects, another feature of how the subjects respond to treatments. We can distinguish those among the clusters as well, and apply partial pooling, and get better estimates as before. In the upper plot you just have varying intercepts. Each line is a differen tcluster (chimp or tank). They all have the same response (slope). In the lower one we let the slopes vary. We want to do this quite often. "}

There could be 0 average, but some poeple could benefit hugely from it. Personalised medicine is trying to leverage this. e.g education. Not everyone benefits from after school programs, but some do, so looking at average effects is not useful. "}

## Varying slopes by construction

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Statistically, the major conceptual innovation is that with varying slopes is you could treat them the same as varying intercepts. But you can do even better than that by noticing that the intercepts and slopes are related in the population. When you learn about the intercetpp, you often get informatyion about the slope. Why? Because tye're lines, adn when you change the slope, you change the intercept. Now think about a single prior that has both the intercepts and slopes inside it. We'lll have a popualtion of features. There's a correlation structure among those features, which lets you transfer infomraiton across the features. Think about your friends or family, There is a correlation structure. There are now other things you expect Brendan to like when you find out he likes Death Metal. That's correlation structure."}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Think back to the cafe example. Before you order your coffee in Berlin, you should update your estimate for Paris even though you left it behind. Now let's extend it. Your robot is your model. How do you get it to learn by visiting cafes. Now it keeps track of the time of day. Average wait time at 9am is longer than at 2pm. So we want to make that distinction. Code it as the difference between afternoon and evening. These two things are related by teh causal properties of cafes. This is toy data. Top is a popular cafe, with a big drop in wait time between morning and afternoon. Cafe B has a much smaller diffference in wait time because there's no morning saturation."}

***14.1.1. Simulate the population***



```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Now we have some statistical population, and there's a negative correlation between the intercepts (average wait time in the morning, standardsied), and the slope (dfiference between morning and afternooon).

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="The agent of our pooling now is a 2D Gaussian. We're going to have both parameters inside it. You need both a vector of means (average intercept and average slope). Then you need a variance-covarinace matrix. It assumes the posterior was multivariate Guassian, and approximated with this kind of entity. Now we'll be more explicit about it. We'll have covariances as part of the model now. THe simplest one is shown here - tey multi-dimensional analogue of sigma. If you add more dimensions to the Guassian distribution. Then there's the correlation between the two. SO you need three parameters to describe the covariance. $\\sigma_a$ is the standard deviation of the intercepts. Square that for the variance. Then there's the covariance, which is the product of the two variances times this correlation coefficient $\\rho$. The book has a box that explains why the covariance is the product of the variances times the correlation coefficient. That's the definition of correlation. "}

If you have two values with a really strong correlation, that constrains the other values because they're also correlated with those two. As the matrix gets really big, the constraints get really strong. And in a big correlation matrix, it's really hard to get strong correlations.

Now see what happens when we also condition directly on $Q$, as in $Q \rightarrow W \leftarrow E$.

```{r 14.25 b}
b14.5 <-
  brm(data = dat_sim,
      family = gaussian,
      w ~ 1 + e + q,
      prior = c(prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept),
                prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,  
      seed = 14,
      file = "fits/b14.05")
```

```{r}
print(b14.5)
```

Holy smokes that's a mess. This model suggests both $E$ and $Q$ have moderate to strong effects on $W$, even though we know neither do based on the true data-generating model. 

The statistical solution is as follows:

```{r 14.26 b}
e_model <- bf(e ~ 1 + q)
w_model <- bf(w ~ 1 + e)

b14.6 <-
  brm(data = dat_sim, 
      family = gaussian,
      e_model + w_model + set_rescor(TRUE),
      prior = c(# E model
                prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept, resp = e),
                prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b, resp = e),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma, resp = e),
                
                # W model
                prior(normal(0, 0.2), class = Intercept, resp = w),
                prior(normal(0, 0.5), class = b, resp = w),
                prior(exponential(1), class = sigma, resp = w),
                
                # rho
                prior(lkj(2), class = rescor)),
      iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,
      seed = 14,
      file = "fits/b14.06")
```

```{r}
print(b14.6)
```


Now the parameter for $E \rightarrow W$, `w_e`, is just where it should be -- near zero. The residual correlation between $E$ and $Q$ is positive and large in magnitude, indicating their common influence from the unmeasured variable $U$.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="This works. First thing to look at are the regression effects. No confound there. Now look at our unconfounded education. Notice that `Rho[1,2]` is the correlation between education and wages, after having conditioned on the instrument - so it's the effect of the confound. Positive correlations, which give you clues about what it could be. "}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(slides_dir, '27.png'))
```

Now adjust the simulation and try a scenario in which education has a positive influence but the confound hides it:

```{r 14.28 b}
set.seed(73)

dat_sim <-
  tibble(u_sim = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1),
         q_sim = sample(1:4, size = n, replace = T)) %>% 
  mutate(e_sim = rnorm(n, mean = u_sim + q_sim, sd = 1)) %>% 
  mutate(w_sim = rnorm(n, mean = -u_sim + 0.2 * e_sim, sd = 1)) %>% 
  mutate(w = standardize(w_sim),
         e = standardize(e_sim),
         q = standardize(q_sim))

dat_sim
```

Update the models:

```{r 14.27 b}
b14.4x <-
  update(b14.4,
         newdata = dat_sim,
         iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4,  
         seed = 14,

With the help from `b14.6x`, we found "that E and W have a negative correlation in their residual variance, because the confound positively influences one and negatively influences the other" (p. 459).

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Here's the problem. TThe 0.24 correlation is produced both by generalised effects, and household-specific (or dyadic) effects.

Some households are more generous to others. There's also generalised receiving, $r_B$. These generalised effects are contaminating.

## Continuous categories and the Gaussian process

All of the varying effects so far, whether they were intercepts or slopes, have been defined over discrete, unordered categories. For example, cafÃ©s are unique places, and there is no sense in which cafÃ© 1 comes before cafÃ© 2.

But what about continuous dimensions of variation like age or income or stature? Individuals of the same age share some of the same exposures. They listened to some of the same music, heard about the same politicians, and experienced the same weather events. And individuals of similar ages also experienced some of these same exposures, but to a lesser extent than individuals of the same age.

It doesnât make sense to estimate a unique varying intercept for all individuals of the same age, ignoring the fact that individuals of similar ages should have more similar intercepts.

Luckily, there is a way to apply the varying effects approach to continuous categories of this kind. This will allow us to estimate a unique intercept (or slope) for any age, while still regarding age as a continuous dimension in which similar ages have more similar intercepts (or slopes). The general approach is known as GAUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION.

If you plotted this graph by age, you would see this view. Interesting view that the hills and valleys line up, even though in any particular year it can move up and down quite a lot. 2008 is much lower down across all age groups. Bu tthe peaks and valleys are in teh same place. These are cohort effecs. Something abou thteh year you're born in sets your politial preference for live. It's something that heppns to people born around that time that happens in their life. "}

Things that happen when you're older don't have nearly as much of an effect. Year of birth is linear, but also a category. It's an orderd category.

Make the naÃ¯ve model, exploring the conditional relations of log(body mass) and log(group size) on log(brain size) without accounting for phylogenetic relationships.

## Bonus: Multilevel growth models and the MELSM

One of the two goals of this bonus section to provide a brief introduction multilevel models designed to express *change over time*. The particular brand of multilevel models weâll focus on are often called multilevel growth models. Though we will focus on simple linear models, this basic framework can be generalized along many lines. The second goal is to build on our appreciation of covariance structures by introducing a class of multilevel models designed to investigate variation in variation called the mixed-effects location scale models (MELSM). For our final model, we get a little fancy and fit a multivariate MELSM.

Load the data:

```{r}
dat <- 
  readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse_2_ed/master/data/m_melsm_dat.csv") %>% 
  dplyr::rename(X1 = `...1`) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(day01 = (day - 2) / max((day - 2)))

glimpse(dat)
```

These data are from 193 participants:
```{r}
distinct(dat, record_id) %>% 
  count()
```

Participants were asked to complete self-report ratings once a day for a few months.

```{r}
dat %>% 
  count(record_id) %>% 
  summarise(median = median(n),
            min = min(n),
            max = max(n))
```

How many days they participated in the study:
```{r}
dat %>% 
  count(record_id) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = n)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#B1934A") +
  scale_x_continuous("number of days", limits = c(0, NA)) +
  theme_pearl_earring()
```

In this study, participants completed the PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) once a day by endorsing the extent to which they experienced various positive (e.g., excited, inspired) and negative (e.g., upset, afraid) emotional states.

In the current data, the standardized versions of these scores are in the `P_A.std` and `N_A.std` columns, respectively.

```{r}
set.seed(14)

dat %>% 
  nest(data = c(X1, P_A.std, day, P_A.lag, N_A.lag, steps.pm, steps.pmd, N_A.std, day01)) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 16) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = N_A.lag)) +
  geom_line(color = "#80A0C7") +
  geom_point(color = "#FCF9F0", size = 1/2) +
  ylab("negative affect (standardized)") +
  facet_wrap(~ record_id)
