Now this is trying to predict the effect of moving a country to a different continent. y-axis is expected improvement if we move the nation to Africa. At low ruggedness you expect it to hurt the economy, but at high ruggedness you expect it to help it. We can see that this interpretation is causally ridiculous. But the model doesn’t see them as different things. The reason this is confusing is because there is causal information in your head. You want to interpret the variables in certain ways.
