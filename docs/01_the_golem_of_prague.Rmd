They're virtual entities made of bits. They're animated by truth in the sense that we're trying to discover the true state of nature, in order to make it better. Your ANOVA doesn't know what you want, and it can wreck Prague. All models are not even false. (George Box). The mistake is that they're not false or true, they're just engines. Just robots. Just tools. The real question is how it behaves, and in which contexts are they useful?"}

You need engineering skills. These tests are little golems - statistical procedures - that think only about randomisation problems with large effects. They're discussed as if they're rational entities. They produce inferences, but not decisions. I want to talk you out of the idea that the purpose of a statistical procedure is to falsify a hypothesis. $P$"}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Here's an example why. Statistical models are not hypotheses. Last century, there was a big fight about whether evolution is neutral - most molecular variation had nothing to do with selection. This leads to a mathematical model - neutral equilibrium. To test this, you need another model, a statistical version. You can think about different time scales and frequency histograms. This would be the model on the far right. People did early tests, and it was very hard to reject the hypothesis that evolution is neutral. There's another class of hypotheses called 'selection matters'. But there are different ways that it matters, so you have to make multiple process models. The fluctuating selection model creates the exact same predictions as the neutral model. Multiple process models make the same predictions. You don't realise you're going to get into trouble if you only use one model. There will be multiple non-null models, and our job is to figure out the difference."}

```{r, echo = F, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Most scientists say he's the only philosopher. Most of his work is not famous. He demarcates what's science and what isn't. Confirmation requires having more than one model, and seeing which is consistent with your observations. You need to build a substantive theory that *explains* what is occurring.\nIn Popper's theory of falsification, you're falsifying the *explanatory* model, not some null model. We should be making predictions about what will be happening, and try to falsify those. Build a substantive research hypothesis with point predictions and falsify those, rather than some null model that nothing's happening. Because something is always happening. This is nature. Things are correlated. We should expect it. The question is to understand its structure."}
